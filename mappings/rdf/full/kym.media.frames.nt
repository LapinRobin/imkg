Prior to the emergence of \"derp,\" other indecipherable phrases have been used for reverse-captioning threads such as fgsfds and hurr durr.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/derp> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On Urban Dictionary[4], there are a total of 31 entry submissions defining the word \"Derp,\" with the earliest instance dating back to May 21st, 2003. Several entries credit Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the coinage of the term, as shown in the 1998 film Baseketball.The influence of \"derp\" continued to grow on 4chan through captioned image macros and the term became increasingly used as a non-descriptive placeholder in its text form. Initially, the practice was limited to the basic pairing of an appropriate image and the caption \"derp\", but it soon evolved into wordplays on the names of celebrity subjects depicted in the macros.In addition, the parody of Rob Schneider's movie trailer in \"The Biggest Douche in the Universe\" was particularly well received among the fans. The \"Derp\" soundbite became widely used for Derprolling, a bait-and-switch linking practice, on 4chan's imageboards and elsewhere beginning in May 2007. A Memebase[2] site for Derp derivatives was launched on June 20th, 2010. A Facebook[5] fan page has 25,662 likes as of August 22nd, 2011.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cyberbullying> <https://meme4.science/about> "Cyberbullying is the act of using the internet, social media and related technologies to harass a specific individual or group in a deliberate, repeated and hostile manner. With more people falling victim to cyberbullying every year, a series of legislative efforts and awareness campaigns have arisen to combat the phenomenon.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cyberbullying> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Discussion of online harassment and defamation has taken place since as early as 1996, when Canadian lawyers David Potts and Sally Harris presented a paper titled Defamation on the Internet[7] at the Legal Issues on the Internet conference on May 14th, 1996. The term \"cyberbullying\" was coined by Canadian teacher and public speaker Bill Belsey[1], who launched cyberbullying.ca[3] on March 3rd, 2003 in conjunction with the anti-bullying website he launched three years prior, bullying.org.[4] In an interview with the Huffington Post[5], Belsey explained that he launched the site after bullying.org began receiving stories about students who were being harassed online.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cyberbullying> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On March 29th, 2003, The Kingston Whig-Standard newspaper published the first article on Cyberbullying[6], citing the case of a student in Ontario whose classmates created a website to anonymously share hateful messages about him. In May 2004, Macleans Canada published an article[11] about the cyberbullying experienced by Ghyslain Raza after a video of him known as \"Star Wars Kid\" went viral online. The experience led him to seek counseling while his family launched a lawsuit against those harassing him.In November 2004, privacy lawyer Parry Aftab[8] launched NetBullies.com.[10] In February 2005, Aftab also launched the first American cyberbullying prevention program, StopCyberbullying.org[9], which encourages victims to step away from the computer, block their harasser and tell an adult about the situation. In April 2005, The Cyberbullying Research Center[12] was created to monitor and track bullying trends in schools. They posted data in 2013 that revealed an average of 23.9% of middle school students had been a victim of online harassment between 2007 and 2011.On June 27th, 2007, the Pew Internet and American Life Project released their first report on Cyberbullying[13], where they found that 32% of the teenagers polled that went online regularly had been cyberbullied. As reports of suicides caused by cyberbulling began to emerge in late 2007, it began to gain more news media attention, with stories on the phenomenon appearing in the New York Times[18] and on NPR.[19] In May 2008, the first federal law against cyberbullying was proposed to the House by Californian Rep. Linda Sánchez and Missourian Rep. Kenny Hulshof[20], but it did not receive traction.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trolling-troll> <https://meme4.science/about> "Troll or Trolling is a slang term used to describe any internet user or their behavior that is meant to intentionally anger or frustrate someone else, though not to be confused with cyberbullying, a form of online harassment carried out against an individual in a deliberately hostile manner (often without any reason) or pranking, which similarly involves playing jokes on strangers for one's amusement (but typically implies more coordination and intent).".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wat> <https://meme4.science/about> "\"Wat\" is a variant of the English word \"what\" that is often used to express confusion or disgust, much like its better known acronym \"WTF\", short for \"what the fuck.\" Although the term \"wat\" is most frequently used as an interjection without a question mark, it is sometimes used to caption reaction face images or peculiar images that would evoke similar responses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wat> <https://meme4.science/origin> "According to the Online Etymology Dictionary[8], the interrogative word \"what\" stems from the Old English \"Hwæt\", an exclamation that roughly translates to \"so.\" The term is also used in the opening line of Old English epic poem Beowolf: \"Hwæt! We Gardena \" || \"in gear-dagum.\" (\"So! The Spear-Danes in days gone by.\")One of the first relevant Urban Dictionary[1] definitions was submitted by user Age on April 21st, 2003:According to Encyclopedia Dramatica, colloquial use of the term \"wat\" originated from the Something Awful forums, specifically in the FYAD (F**k You and Die) sub-community. However, this notion has not been verified.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wat> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Over a dozen entries defining the term \"wat\" were submitted throughout the decade, leading up to the currently top voted definition of the word, which was was submitted on September 4th, 2008 by user watwat.[2]Encyclopedia Dramatica[3] defines the word as a response to the most confusing of statements or attempts at non-sequitur humor, as well as overly lengthy explanations in comments or posts similar to the usage of tl;dr.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/advice-animals> <https://meme4.science/about> "Advice Animals, sometimes referred to as \"Advice Dog spin-offs\", are a type of image macro series featuring animals of some kind (including humans) that are accompanied by captioned text to represent a character trait or an archetype that fits the role of a \"stock character\".[7] While many Advice Animals use a color wheel background, some use unedited versions of the original photo.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/advice-animals> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The name \"Advice Animals\" is taken from the Advice Dog image macro series that originated on September 7th, 2006. The image was first posted on the Mushroom Kingdom forums[1], and displayed a labrador puppy with the iconic color wheel background. The creator, Evan Herrington, said he was inspired by the \"royal rainbow\" from the Katamari Damacy video game series.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kappa> <https://meme4.science/about> "Kappa is a graphic emoticon commonly used by trolls as a postscript to a sentence to convey sarcasm on the live streaming video platform Twitch; it's popularity has also lead to the emoticon being used as a form of spam.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kappa> <https://meme4.science/spread> "As of February 2014, the emote is used 900,000 times on average per day;[2] by June 2015 this had already increased to around 1 million times on average per day. Twitch has added a total of four emotes featuring Kappa: Kappa (), Keepo (), MiniK () and KappaHD (); another unique Kappa titled KappaRoss ( ), featuring the original with Bob Ross' hair, was added in October 2015 in celebration of Twitch Creative. On February 18th, 2012, r/kappa/ subreddit was established.[3] It has got over 13,900 readers. On July 13th, 2014, first submission for Kappa on Urban Dictionary was made,[4] and on October 13th, the top definition of the \"Kappa\" emote was submitted by R4D1AT10N.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/year> "".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another.[2] A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

Originally posted via /b/ board in February 2010, these cartoons illustrate triumphant moments. This phenomenon can also be seen as the antithesis to Rageguy comics, another four-pane series originating from 4chan circa late 2008.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fuck-yea> <https://meme4.science/origin> "While the original post is no longer available, Know Your Meme user Stefan published the earliest known version of the meme on February 11th, 2010. The meme features a stick figure playing and winning a level in Guitar Hero (shown below).

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/2-girls-1-cup> <https://meme4.science/about> "2 Girls 1 Cup is the colloquial name for the trailer for the Brazilian scat coprophagic fetish adult film Hungry Bitches made by MFX Media in 2007. In the clip, two women defecate into a cup and take turns consuming the cup's contents, before vomiting into each other's mouths. The extremely graphic nature of the clip, as well as the soundtrack accompaniment of \"Lovers Theme\" by Hervé Roy, caused it to go viral in late 2007, with many internet users posting their own or others' reactions to seeing the video for the first time. This phenomenon received significant attention from the media.As a result, 2girls1cup.com, hosting the most viewed mirror of the trailer, would become one of the most famous shock sites in internet history. The name, \"2 Girls 1 Cup\" has also been subject to parody, exemplified in shock sites such as 3Guys1Hammer.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/2-girls-1-cup> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Brazilian distributor and pornographer Marco Fiorito directed Hungry Bitches and his company MFX Media released the film on January 5th, 2007. Fiorito, a self-described \"compulsive fetishist,\" came under fire from United States authorities, calling his films obscene. On his films, Fiorito said, \"I have already made fetish movies with scat/feces using chocolate instead of feces. Many actors make scat films, but they don't agree to eat feces.\"[1]Months after the film's release, on August 12th, 2007, the website 2girls1cup.com launched. The site hosted the video until the site's deactivation.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/2-girls-1-cup> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Within one month of the site's launch, more than 400,000 people visited the site, spending less than 30 seconds online. The following month, that number jumped to 2 million visits. Between December 2007 and January 2008, the site received more than 8 million visits.On August 29th, 2007, Urban Dictionary [3] user DeeZeal defined the video, \"One of the most disgusting videos on the internet. It makes goatse and tubgirl look mainstream by comparison. The video features two girls enjoying one cup. And by enjoying I mean tastefully defecating into it, licking it, pucking in it and then into each other's mouths. The sickest viral video on the net, hands down!\" The post received more than 4,000 upvotes in less than 14 years (shown below).Over the next few months, the video began growing in popularity online, particularly because of reaction videos that feature people watching the film. On September 21st, 2007, YouTuber fartenewt posted one of the earliest reaction videos, receiving more than 14 million views in less than 14 years (shown below, left).\"2 Girls 1 Cup's\" viral success also led internet users to explore even more disturbing shock videos (the most famous of these being \"Pain Olympics\"), and posting similar reactions to them.By November, reaction videos were going viral on YouTube. On November 3rd, YouTuber Jame Andy posted a reaction video that received more than 22 million views in less than 14 years (shown below, right).The viral success of the video also inspired numerous parodies and other comedic content based on the clip. On November 1st, comedian Jon Lajoie, best known for his role on the television series The League, published a parody song about the video. Within 14 years, the post received more than 14 million views (shown below).On August 10th, 2010, the creator of the 2girls1cup website participated in a Reddit [2]AMA. In their introduction, the unnamed owner of the site says that they saw the video on a messageboard and created a single-use site that would auto-play the clip. After the first month, they said that they forgot they had hosted the video, but after being charged by the hosting company due to overage charges, they saw the steady success of the page.As the site reached its peak, they decided to sell the 2girls1cup.com because they \"had been cut from all revenue sources due to the site nature and were losing money quick, we were barely breaking even for server costs and all the other good stuff.\" They sold the site in February 2008.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

However, the barrel roll maneuver was later included as a move in the Super Nintendo console game Star Fox that was released in the U.S. in the spring of 1993. In the game, the player could perform a barrel roll by double-tapping the L and R buttons, protecting the ship from enemy lasers.The specific phrase \"do a barrel roll\" that's referenced in memes comes from the sequel Star Fox 64, released on June 30th, 1997, in which the character Peppy Hare (voiced by Rick May) orders you to \"do a barrel roll!\" while approaching four stationary turrets firing lasers in the game. On June 4th, 2007, YouTuber[9] DeusExBenigma uploaded the earliest known and highest-viewed video of this scene and meme, receiving over 5.9 million views, 32,000 likes and 4,700 comments in roughly 15 years (seen below).".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".

On April 24th, 2008, a thread was posted about the campaign on the Texas Longhorns enthusiast HornsFans[16] forums, in which forum member wolfman compared Goldsmith's character to the martial artist Chuck Norris.On May 25th, 2009, the news blog Slate[10] published an article, claiming the ads took \"aesthetic cues\" from the work of film director Wes Anderson. On June 4th, the food blog Eat Me Daily[5] posted about the campaign, remarking that the character had its own Twitter-impersonator (the Twitter[17] account has since been deleted). On July 2nd, People Magazine[11] interviewed Jonathan Goldsmith, who revealed he lived on a 47-foot boat in California.

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta> <https://meme4.science/about> "Navy Seal Copypasta (also known as the “Marine Copypasta”, \"Internet Tough Guy Copypasta” and “Gorilla Warfare Copypasta”) is a facetious message containing a series of ridiculous claims and grandiose threats that portray the poster as an Internet tough guy stereotype. In the original post, the writer claimed to be a former Navy Seal with a long history of combat experiences, using comical typos and hyperboles like \"Gorilla Warfare,\" “300 Confirmed Kills” and “I can kill you in over 700 ways with just my bare hands.” Since its emergence in mid-2012, the copypasta has spawned a variety of spin-off stories, similar to the John Copypasta meme.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The copypasta is believed to have originated on the military and weapons enthusiast image board Operator Chan sometime in 2010. The earliest archived posting was submitted on November 11th, 2010 to 4chan's /jp/[4] (Otaku Culture) board, in which the poster claimed to have seen the message previously on Operator Chan.On May 24th, 2012, an anonymous user submitted a thread to the /pasta/[1] board, claiming he had created the original copypasta two to three years prior (shown below).[2]".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On April 4th, 2012, Redditor fahottie submitted a screenshot of a YouTube comment featuring the copypasta to the /r/funny[8] subreddit (shown below), where it received more than 20,000 up votes and 970 comments prior to being archived.On May 22nd, YouTuber Copypasta Sings uploaded a musical version of the copypasta (shown below), which received over 87,000 views and 780 comments in the next nine months.On August 17th, Urban Dictionary[7] member 487j submitted an entry for the term \"gorilla warfare,\" defining it as training that \"fake Navy Seals\" receive. On November 16th, Newgrounds[5] user JoePorter134 uploaded a dramatic reading of the copypasta. On January 10th, 2013, Redditor LiterallyKesha submitted the message to the /r/copypasta[3] subreddit and provided links to several notable variations. In the next month, the post received over 75 up votes and 135 comments.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/slender-man> <https://meme4.science/about> "Slender Man (a.k.a Slenderman) is a mythical creature often depicted as a tall, thin figure wearing a black suit and a blank face. According to the legend, he can stretch or shorten his arms at will and has tentacle-like appendages protruding from his back. Depending on the interpretations of the myth, the creature may cause memory loss, insomnia, paranoia, coughing fits (nicknamed \"slendersickness\"), photograph/video distortions and can teleport at will. The urban legend has inspired fan arts, fictional creepypastas and a mockumentary series in the style of the 1999 indie horror film Blair Witch Project. As the character has grown in popularity, he's gained a number of other nicknames including The Operator, Der Großmann, Mr. Slim, The Administrator, Daddy LongLegs, Mr. Thin, The Tall Man, The Thin Man and Slendy.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/slender-man> <https://meme4.science/origin> "On June 8th, 2009, a \"'paranormal pictures\" photoshop contest was launched on the Something Awful (SA) Forums.[1] The contest required participants to turn ordinary photographs into creepy-looking images through digital manipulation and then pass them on as authentic photographs on a number of paranormal forums. Something Awful users soon began sharing their faux-paranormal creations with layered images of ghosts and other anomalies, usually accompanied by a fabricated witness account to make them more convincing. On June 10th, SA user Victor Surge (real name Eric Knudsen) posted two black and white photographs of unnamed children with a short description of \"Slender Man\" as a mysterious creature who stalked children.[2]On June 11th, 2009, Victor Surge continued to improve upon the myth by adding another picture and a fake doctor's account.[3] The following day, SA user LeechCode5[4] posted a photograph of a burning building with a Slender Man back story. On June 14th, SA goon TrenchMaul[6] reused the Slender Man character for his own story. The original thread, which still remains active today, extends for 46 pages as of June 2011.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/slender-man> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Slender Man became a well-known mythical creature on the /x/ (paranormal) 4chan board.[7] The earliest known mention of \"Slender Man\" on 4chan can be found in an archived thread dating back to June 24th, 2009, though the conversation suggests that it had been mentioned prior. The image was coupled with hand-drawn illustrations and fanart.Outside of 4chan, Slender Man has caught the attention of several websites including the Unfiction Forums[8], Fangoria[9], Bungie,[10] Facepunch,[11] Wikibin,[12] /x/enopedia,[13] TVTropes,[14] Kongregate,[15] DeviantArt,[16] SlenderNation,[17] and Mythical Creatures Guide.[18]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/about> "Copypasta is internet slang for any block of text that gets copied and pasted over and over again, typically disseminated by individuals through online discussion forums and social networking sites. The term is an English portmanteau of \"copy,\" \"paste\" and \"pasta.\" Although it shares some characteristics with spam in the sense they're both unsolicited (and often considered a nuisance), copypastas are mainly spread through human operators whereas the latter is automatically generated by electronic messaging systems.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "This simple concept of \"manually copying text from one place and pasting it elsewhere\" has been in practice since the innovation of basic text-editing commands (copy/cut/paste) in the early 1980s and subsequent rise of spamming in the early 1990s. In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of \"cut and paste\" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1]The origin of the term \"copypasta\" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, \"An amount of lengthy text that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to an irrelevant subject.\" The post received more than 170 upvotes in less than 15 years (shown below).".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On September 9th, 2009, Redditor Null_Slate launched the /r/copypasta[3] subreddit. Attracting more than 78,000 users in less than 12 years, the subreddit allows users to share text to various copypasta templates.Nearly a decade later, on September 14th, 2018, Merriam Webster's Dictionary[4] considered \"copypasta\" in their \"Words We're Watching\" series.

In recent years, some authors have re-appropriated the genre into an effective pretext for bait-and-switch trolling.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "While folklores have been an essential part of cultural traditions for many centuries, the term \"urban legend\" began appearing in print publications as early as 1968 and became widespread through a series of books written by English professor Jan Harold Brunvand in the early 1980s. Since then, the word has become closely associated with short horror or mystery stories set in modern day. Starting in the 1990s, chain letter e-mails quickly emerged as the primary medium for sharing such stories on the Internet. [1]The Internet slang term \"creepypasta,\" which is derived from copypasta, did not enter the 4chan community's vernacular until mid-2007, with the earliest known archived thread[2] dating back to July 6th.".

Try Creepypasta, or Web Scares\"[11] was published on November 12th, 2010. A Facebook[13] fan page has 9,277 likes as of October 28th, 2011.

The term is an English portmanteau of \"copy,\" \"paste\" and \"pasta.\" Although it shares some characteristics with spam in the sense they're both unsolicited (and often considered a nuisance), copypastas are mainly spread through human operators whereas the latter is automatically generated by electronic messaging systems.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "This simple concept of \"manually copying text from one place and pasting it elsewhere\" has been in practice since the innovation of basic text-editing commands (copy/cut/paste) in the early 1980s and subsequent rise of spamming in the early 1990s. In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of \"cut and paste\" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1]The origin of the term \"copypasta\" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, \"An amount of lengthy text that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to an irrelevant subject.\" The post received more than 170 upvotes in less than 15 years (shown below).".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".

They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another.[2] A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

The term is an English portmanteau of \"copy,\" \"paste\" and \"pasta.\" Although it shares some characteristics with spam in the sense they're both unsolicited (and often considered a nuisance), copypastas are mainly spread through human operators whereas the latter is automatically generated by electronic messaging systems.".

In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of \"cut and paste\" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1]The origin of the term \"copypasta\" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, \"An amount of lengthy text that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to an irrelevant subject.\" The post received more than 170 upvotes in less than 15 years (shown below).".

Chuck Testa.”The video remained largely unnoticed until it was submitted to Reddit in a post titled \"This is probably the funniest low-budget commercial I have ever seen\"[4] by user LunaMcLovin on September 15th, 2011.

The comic was posted online as early as October 1st, 2009 on the Studio Kat forums[1] in a thread to share absurd images.".

Due to the juxtaposition of the name Ashraf next to the reaction image, it was referred to as the \"Ashraf face\" (below left) in comments on the rage comics subreddit[3] and in their official rage face timeline.[4] During 2011, both versions of the face were applied to several other rage comic tropes, expressing surprised awareness in She Wants My Cock (below center) and a frustrating realization about one's ethnic background in Being an X (below right).".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Ironic Memes are memes that are used satirically, usually by being deliberately humorless, crude or overused, as a way to both criticize meme or meme elitism cultures. Ironic memes often spawn as a response to overuse with time, usually due to \"The Family Guy Effect,\" as well as to simply catch those with less internet experience off guard. The use of ironic memes often includes intentional overuse of older internet phenomena, like 1337 speak or Rage Comics, as well as the use of the word \"meme\" as a replacement for some parts of speech, such as nouns or verbs. Ironic memes trace back to roughly mid-2008 and were popularized on platforms like 4chan, YouTube and Reddit.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Although the exact first use of the term \"ironic meme\" online is unknown, the ironic fandom of Disney's Cory in the House beginning in mid-2008 with the remix video \"Top 27 Anime Boobs,\" uploaded on August 23rd, 2008, by YouTuber[1] TheSaltySaltySalt, serves as one of the earliest known examples of an ironic meme (shown below). Spawned from a running joke that referred to Cory in the House as an anime, this early ironic meme was originally created on 4chan's /v/ board and became the source of a tongue-in-cheek running gag following the release of a video game for the Nintendo DS based on the series. This video was first uploaded in 2007 but was deleted and reuploaded afterward, accumulating over 875,000 views, 5,700 likes, 3,500 dislikes and 1,700 comments in roughly 12 and a half years.Photoshopped images of Cory and screenshots of the various dialogue screens from the game were widespread in early ironic meme culture, while the game itself was constantly used as a way of trolling whenever the leak of a new game was asked and as an ironic response in \"favorite videogame\" threads.[2] This ironic humor then spread to Reddit shortly after, particularly to the /r/gaming and /r/askreddit subreddits.[3]".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On September 15th, 2008, the gimmick Twitter account Dril posted its first tweet with simply \"no\" as the only text, serving as an early precursor to ironic meme humor on Twitter.[5]On April 16th, 2009, YouTuber[4] Richalvarez uploaded a Super Mario parody of Smash Mouth's \"All Star,\" titled \"Mario, You're a Plumber,\" which subsequently spawned another ironic fandom in early ironic meme culture. The video went on to garner over 1.6 million views, 13,000 likes and 2,700 comments in about 12 years (seen below).On April 1st, 2013, the online imageboard 4chan launched the /s4s/ (shit 4chan says) board, an April Fool's Day joke imageboard created entirely for nonsensical shitposting. Despite this original purpose, the board was kept online after April Fool's Day. Besides hosting nonsensical posts, the board, also focuses on making \"memes\" out of things that otherwise would not be considered memetic material.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".

Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another.[2] A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Ironic Memes are memes that are used satirically, usually by being deliberately humorless, crude or overused, as a way to both criticize meme or meme elitism cultures. Ironic memes often spawn as a response to overuse with time, usually due to \"The Family Guy Effect,\" as well as to simply catch those with less internet experience off guard. The use of ironic memes often includes intentional overuse of older internet phenomena, like 1337 speak or Rage Comics, as well as the use of the word \"meme\" as a replacement for some parts of speech, such as nouns or verbs. Ironic memes trace back to roughly mid-2008 and were popularized on platforms like 4chan, YouTube and Reddit.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Although the exact first use of the term \"ironic meme\" online is unknown, the ironic fandom of Disney's Cory in the House beginning in mid-2008 with the remix video \"Top 27 Anime Boobs,\" uploaded on August 23rd, 2008, by YouTuber[1] TheSaltySaltySalt, serves as one of the earliest known examples of an ironic meme (shown below). Spawned from a running joke that referred to Cory in the House as an anime, this early ironic meme was originally created on 4chan's /v/ board and became the source of a tongue-in-cheek running gag following the release of a video game for the Nintendo DS based on the series. This video was first uploaded in 2007 but was deleted and reuploaded afterward, accumulating over 875,000 views, 5,700 likes, 3,500 dislikes and 1,700 comments in roughly 12 and a half years.Photoshopped images of Cory and screenshots of the various dialogue screens from the game were widespread in early ironic meme culture, while the game itself was constantly used as a way of trolling whenever the leak of a new game was asked and as an ironic response in \"favorite videogame\" threads.[2] This ironic humor then spread to Reddit shortly after, particularly to the /r/gaming and /r/askreddit subreddits.[3]".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On September 15th, 2008, the gimmick Twitter account Dril posted its first tweet with simply \"no\" as the only text, serving as an early precursor to ironic meme humor on Twitter.[5]On April 16th, 2009, YouTuber[4] Richalvarez uploaded a Super Mario parody of Smash Mouth's \"All Star,\" titled \"Mario, You're a Plumber,\" which subsequently spawned another ironic fandom in early ironic meme culture. The video went on to garner over 1.6 million views, 13,000 likes and 2,700 comments in about 12 years (seen below).On April 1st, 2013, the online imageboard 4chan launched the /s4s/ (shit 4chan says) board, an April Fool's Day joke imageboard created entirely for nonsensical shitposting. Despite this original purpose, the board was kept online after April Fool's Day. Besides hosting nonsensical posts, the board, also focuses on making \"memes\" out of things that otherwise would not be considered memetic material.".

Since its release in mid-July 2012, the highly entertaining music video has spawned hundreds of parodies and copycat dance videos on YouTube and surpassed Justin Bieber's single \"Baby\" as the most watched video on YouTube with over one billion views as of December 21st, 2012.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gangnam-style> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The song \"Gangnam Style\" was written, produced, and recorded as the lead single of PSY 6 (Six Rules), Part 1 the sixth studio album of South Korean singer and rapper PSY, who is best known for his quick-witted sense of humor and comical dance moves. The song was released on July 15th, 2012 along with the music video via PSY's official YouTube channel.Upon its release, the song took off on virtually all Korean billboard charts, portal search sites and online music stores, but it began garnering international attention after the music video went viral on YouTube during the third week of July 2012. The video continued gaining viral momentum at an average rate of more than nine million views per day in the span of two months, surpassing Carly Rae Jepsen's \"Call Me Maybe\" to reach the number one position on the YouTube Top 100 Music Videos chart during the last week of August. By mid-September, PSY's \"Gangnam Style\" overtook LMFAO's \"Party Rock Anthem\" as the most liked video on the site with more than 1.6 million likes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gangnam-style> <https://meme4.science/spread> "The video earned the title of ''viral video'' within days after its release and received intensive coverage from various English-language music blogs and K-POP news sites like AllKPop[8], KPopStars[3] and KoreaBoo[16], as well as other regional Asian news sites including Yahoo! Philippines News[17] and New Zealand music sites Mai FM[9] and George FM.[10] In the following weeks, the music video picked up notable mentions from internet humor and pop music sites, from Gawker[18], BuzzFeed[11] and FunnyJunk[12] to Metafilter[13] and PopDust[14] among others.By the first week of August, PSY's Gangnam Style had been praised as a viral YouTube sensation by major U.S. news outlets like CNN[19], ABC News[20] and The Wall Street Journal[21], further boosting the popularity of his music video. In addition, the song's chorus hook \"Oppan Gangnam Style\" quickly became an in-joke among the English-speaking audiences for its misheard lyrics erroneously referred to as \"Open Condom Style\" or \"Open Gundam Style,\" which also went onto inspire several image macros and top-voted comments on the YouTube video page.Between late July and early August, the song picked up numerous endorsements from high-profile celebrities and musicians on Twitter, including British pop singer Robbie Williams[15], American rapper T-Pain and American singer Josh Groban. Weeks later in mid-August, Korean and U.S. news outlets reported on a rumor that Justin Bieber has also shown interest in PSY's work and a potential collaboration between the two singers was in progress. On September 20th, 2012, \"Gangnam Style\" was officially recognized by the Guinness World Records as the most liked video in YouTube history with 2,141,758 likes at the time of announcement.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ptsd-clarinet-boy> <https://meme4.science/about> "PTSD Clarinet Boy is an advice animal image macro series based on a double exposure portrait of a redheaded boy dressed in a school band uniform holding a clarinet. A full-body image of the uniformed boy gazing out is superimposed on to the back of his head. The captions typically emulate the first-person accounts of a war veteran suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, interpreting the dual images of the boy as him mulling over the past. The captions have since evolved to become similar to those found in the Karate Kyle and Vengeance Dad series, often relating to being deemed a loser in high school.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ptsd-clarinet-boy> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The original image was posted in the single topic blog Awkward Family Photos[1] on July 17th, 2009. Titled \"A Beautiful Mind,\" the caption asked readers to think about what was going on in the young boy's head. By December 2009, the image was picked up by the image macro creating site Meme Generator, where it initially was called \"Veteran PTSD Clarinet Boy,\" adopting the voice of Vietnam war veterans remembering the past. However, it is unclear what the first instance of this was.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ptsd-clarinet-boy> <https://meme4.science/spread> "One of the earliest mentions of the series outside of Meme Generator was posted to the Pro Touring automobile enthusiast forums[10] on December 31st, 2009 in a thread comparing Firebirds and Camaros. On January 8th, 2010, a thread dedicated to the series was posted on the Ultimate Guitar forums.[11] By the end of January, the name of the series had been shortened to PTSD Clarinet Boy and was posted to Tumblr[12] for the first time. One of the earliest archived 4chan threads using the series was posted to /a/ (Anime and Manga) on February 7th, 2010.On February 12th, a thread about PTSD Clarinet Boy was started on the Bodybuilding.com forums[14], generating 12 pages of responses. Four days later, a Facebook fan page[15] for the series was created, gaining just under 1,500 likes as of July 2013. That April, a collection of PTSD Clarinet Boy images were combined in a FunnyJunk[5] post that has since been viewed nearly 25,000 times. The series saw a renewed interest in February 2011 with a compilation posted on Buzzfeed.[16] The next month, a single topic Tumblr titled PTSD Clarinet Kid[17] was created, but was abandoned after 48 posts.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/japanese-honorifics> <https://meme4.science/origin> "While the first instance of their use online in unknown, honorifics are an important part of the Japanese sociolinguistics. Normally they are used when one is referring to one's interlocutor, as using on oneself is often seen as arrogant. Dropping the honorific implies a high degree of intimacy and this action is often reserved for close friends, one's spouse, or social inferiors (for example, a teacher addressing his students). The honorifics fall into three different categories depending on the type of speech the speaker is using (shown below).".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/japanese-honorifics> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Some honorifics were popularized within the Western audience thanks to anime fansubs and manga fan scanlations, in which they are often featured. These usages predate their online usage.Japanese honorifics are in wide conversational use on anime fan-boards and forums, and their use has spread to other subjects where users might have an overlapping interest in anime, including the user forums of 4chan.org and the chat boxes of Twitch.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harlem-shake> <https://meme4.science/about> "\"Harlem Shake\", not to be confused with the hip hop dance style, is the title of a 2012 heavy bass instrumental track produced by Baauer. In February 2013, the song spawned a series of dance videos that begin with a masked individual dancing alone in a group before suddenly cutting to a wild dance party featuring the entire group. Despite what the name suggests,[1] the videos present a wide range of hip hop dances, including the Bernie, Twerking as well as improvisations.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harlem-shake> <https://meme4.science/origin> "\"Harlem Shake\" by Baauer[8], the stage name of American music producer Harry Rodrigues, was uploaded to YouTube on August 23rd, 2012 and released by Diplo's Mad Decent record label, under their sub label Jefferies initially as a free download, along with the B-side \"Yaow!\". The lyric \"do the Harlem Shake\" is a sample from the 2001 track \"Miller Time\" by Philadelphia party rap crew, Plastic Little. The lyric was taken from an incident in member Jayson Musson's life where he got into a fight and finished by getting up and doing the dance. Bauuer's song was met with positive reception from electronica & trap music blogs, as well as other artists including Diplo, Brodinski, and Flosstradamus. On January 30th, 2013, video blogger Filthy Frank uploaded an episode that opens with four people dressed in latex suits dancing to Baauer's \"Harlem Shake\" (shown below, right).".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harlem-shake> <https://meme4.science/spread> "The dance itself is defined by Urban Dictionary as 'An eccentric upper body dance move that involves the shaking of the upper torso and shoulders.' On February 2nd, 2013, several parodies of DizastaMusic's video were uploaded by YouTubers TheSunnyCoastSkate and PHL_On_NAN, the latter of which would go viral on February 5th, amassing 300,000 views within 24 hours and prompting further parodies from other YouTubers shortly after.On February 7th, YouTuber hiimrawn uploaded a version titled \"Harlem Shake v3 (office edition)\" (shown below is a re-upload from a different user) featuring the staff of online video production company Maker Studios. The video instantly went viral, amassing more than 7.4 million views in the first week, as well as inspiring a notable subset of contributions from well-known Internet companies, including BuzzFeed,[2] CollegeHumor, Vimeo and Facebook[7] among many others.[4][5][6]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

In recent years, some authors have re-appropriated the genre into an effective pretext for bait-and-switch trolling.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "While folklores have been an essential part of cultural traditions for many centuries, the term \"urban legend\" began appearing in print publications as early as 1968 and became widespread through a series of books written by English professor Jan Harold Brunvand in the early 1980s. Since then, the word has become closely associated with short horror or mystery stories set in modern day. Starting in the 1990s, chain letter e-mails quickly emerged as the primary medium for sharing such stories on the Internet. [1]The Internet slang term \"creepypasta,\" which is derived from copypasta, did not enter the 4chan community's vernacular until mid-2007, with the earliest known archived thread[2] dating back to July 6th.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another.[2] A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".

The term is an English portmanteau of \"copy,\" \"paste\" and \"pasta.\" Although it shares some characteristics with spam in the sense they're both unsolicited (and often considered a nuisance), copypastas are mainly spread through human operators whereas the latter is automatically generated by electronic messaging systems.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "This simple concept of \"manually copying text from one place and pasting it elsewhere\" has been in practice since the innovation of basic text-editing commands (copy/cut/paste) in the early 1980s and subsequent rise of spamming in the early 1990s. In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of \"cut and paste\" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1]The origin of the term \"copypasta\" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, \"An amount of lengthy text that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to an irrelevant subject.\" The post received more than 170 upvotes in less than 15 years (shown below).".

On September 3rd, user inousukessweatyfeet posted the sound to TikTok, gaining over 409,000 likes (shown below, left). After their post, the sound was used in 17,000 videos over the following two weeks, with many videos joking about discovering the sound's pornographic origins.

While some macros use captions parodying the ridiculous and oftentimes unnecessary stunts Grylls performs on the show, they typically focus on the consumption of his own urine.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bear-grylls-better-drink-my-own-piss> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Since the on-air debut of Man vs. Wild in 2006, the series has grown into an internationally distributed cable show with over 1.2 billion viewers. According to the show's Wikipedia[1] entry, Grylls has climbed cliffs, parachuted from a variety of aircraft, ran through a forest fire, ate snakes and utilized a sheep corpse as a flotation device. Grylls has also been known to drink his own urine to prevent dehydration, which he demonstrated in Episode 13: Kimberley, Australia:On September 7th, 2010, Redditor Faneste123 submitted a post titled “The Sun Is Going Down”[2], which included a Bear Grylls image macro with the caption “The sun is going down / better drink my own piss\" in reference to his demonstration of urine-drinking in the episode. The post reached the front page of the /r/pics subreddit, receiving over 2,313 up votes prior to being archived.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

While the colloquial use of the word in East Asian cultures predates its online popularity, the term has been since adopted by Otaku circles and anime fans to refer to one's favorite female manga or anime character. The male equivalent is commonly referred to as a \"Husbando\"".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/waifu> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The term \"Waifu\" was first introduced to the English-speaking audiences through a scene from the popular high school anime series Azumanga Daioh, which aired in Japan from April to September 2002 and later released as a DVD set in the United States in September 2005. In the scene, the protagonist's perverted homeroom teacher Mr. Kimura drops a photograph of a mysterious woman on the classroom floor. When asked by his students about the person in the picture, Mr. Kimura simply replies: \"Mai Waifu.\"".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/waifu> <https://meme4.science/spread> "The Engrish word \"waifu\" stuck with the English-speaking fans and throughout the latter half of 2000s, the term became heavily used by both anime fans and trolls on 4chan's /a/ (anime & manga) board, as a term of endearment to refer to a female character and as a flamebait to mock the obsessive nature of the subculture, respectively. As \"mai waifu\" continued to appear on 4chan, a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) addressing the term was created as a supplement to the /a/ board.The first and only Urban Dictionary definition for \"Mai Waifu\" was created by user Surhta on April 2nd, 2007.However, the use of \"mai waifu\" is not restrictedly solely to anime or manga characters, as it has been seen with images of non-Japanese cartoon characters or even photographs of real life celebrities.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/raimiposting> <https://meme4.science/about> "Raimiposting or Raimi-posting refers to an act of misquoting dialogue from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy in a prejudiced or insensitive manner, usually from the perspective of a moviegoer shocked by the decision to include offensive themes in a PG-13 film. Originating from 4chan's /tv/ board, the posts are often accompanied by remarks such as \"Jesus Christ, Raimi\" or \"It was a different time\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/raimiposting> <https://meme4.science/origin> "On May 3rd, 2002, superhero film Spider-Man [1] directed by Sam Raimi premiered in the cinemas, followed by the sequels Spider-Man 2 [2] in 2004 and Spider-Man 3 [3] in 2007. The films followed adventures of the high-school student Peter Parker who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and develops superhuman abilities, becoming a superhero named Spider-Man.In one scene of the first film, Spider-Man mocks his opponent Bonesaw by commenting on his outfit with a gay joke.On March 21st, 2014, an anonymous 4chan[4] user posted the quote to /tv/ board, with several commenters pointing out that the quip would cause outrage if Spider-man was released in 2014 due to the joke's homophobic nature. Through 2014 and 2015, the argument received further support in multiple /tv/ threads[5][6][7][8], while on April 22nd, 2014, the joke was labeled \"racist\" by CinemaSins[9] YouTube channel.In one such thread launched on January 17th, 2016, an anonymous user provided a complex analysis of the phrase, reversing the message in the joke[10].On January 27th, 2016, an anonymous 4chan[11] user writing under the nickname Sudowoodo posted a more offensive version of the quote in a /tv/ thread, giving the start to the Raimiposting trend.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/raimiposting> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Through 2016 and 2017, multiple threads and replies in which Spider-Man trilogy dialogs were misquoted in an offensive manner were posted on the /tv/ board[12][13][14][15], with many examples later resurging on the /r/4chan subreddit. In the quotes, Spider-man characters such as Peter Parker, Uncle Ben, Aunt May, Norman Osborn, Doctor Octopus, J. Jonah Jameson and others were presented as homophobic, racist or sociopathic. While the misquotes were usually written in a greentext format, the posts commonly ended with a brief comment in which the poster expressed shock and disgust at Sam Raimi's decision to include offensive dialogue in the films.The word \"Raimi-posting\" was first used by an anonymous 4chan[16] user in the thread launched on March 1st, 2016.".

Though the expanding brain is usually implied to showcase intellectual superiority over various objects, it is more often used in an ironic sense to imply the opposite, where objects of derision are implied to be of higher standard than objects that are usually highly regarded. For example, when used with Whomst, a person who uses \"who\" will be shown with the smallest brain, while a person who uses the most ridiculous variation, i.e. \"whomst'd've\", will be shown with the largest brain.".

A full-body image of the uniformed boy gazing out is superimposed on to the back of his head. The captions typically emulate the first-person accounts of a war veteran suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, interpreting the dual images of the boy as him mulling over the past. The captions have since evolved to become similar to those found in the Karate Kyle and Vengeance Dad series, often relating to being deemed a loser in high school.".

Titled \"A Beautiful Mind,\" the caption asked readers to think about what was going on in the young boy's head. By December 2009, the image was picked up by the image macro creating site Meme Generator, where it initially was called \"Veteran PTSD Clarinet Boy,\" adopting the voice of Vietnam war veterans remembering the past. However, it is unclear what the first instance of this was.".

On January 8th, 2010, a thread dedicated to the series was posted on the Ultimate Guitar forums.[11] By the end of January, the name of the series had been shortened to PTSD Clarinet Boy and was posted to Tumblr[12] for the first time. One of the earliest archived 4chan threads using the series was posted to /a/ (Anime and Manga) on February 7th, 2010.On February 12th, a thread about PTSD Clarinet Boy was started on the Bodybuilding.com forums[14], generating 12 pages of responses. Four days later, a Facebook fan page[15] for the series was created, gaining just under 1,500 likes as of July 2013. That April, a collection of PTSD Clarinet Boy images were combined in a FunnyJunk[5] post that has since been viewed nearly 25,000 times. The series saw a renewed interest in February 2011 with a compilation posted on Buzzfeed.[16] The next month, a single topic Tumblr titled PTSD Clarinet Kid[17] was created, but was abandoned after 48 posts.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/exploitables> <https://meme4.science/about> "Exploitables are a meme template in which a single image is manipulated through various means to achieve the intended, humorous effect. This can involve replacing words in the original image, adding words to the original image, or manipulating positions of objects in the image to change the original's meaning. Exploitables often grow popular due to the fact they don't require extensive photo-editing knowledge to create and can be modified by basic programs such as MS Paint or Photoshop. Multiple types of exploitable meme templates arose throughout the late 2000s and 2010s, and many of the most recognizable memes are exploitables, such as Loss, Distracted Boyfriend and Galaxy Brain.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/exploitables> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Exploitables began becoming a regular part of internet memes in 2006. That year saw the rise of one of the first popular exploitable templates, Bitches Don't Know. The meme originated when MySpace user Rich Owens wore a shirt saying \"Bitches Don't Know Bout My Dick\" (shown below, left) The photo was edited by multiple users to make the shirt read something else (examples shown below, center, right).

The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another.[2] A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

His unique facial expression was taken from a particular scene in which Cage's character Peter Loew torments his secretary in a disturbing manner.The scene from Vampire Kiss was featured in a video titled \"Nicholas Cage Freaking Out,\" uploaded by YouTuber twoworldsfreak01 on July 27th, 2009. A still from the scene was also used as a reaction face in a in a demotivational image captioned with \"Nicolas Cage / Available in Stoic and Batshit Crazy\" uploaded to Roflrazzi[13] on August 15th, 2009. The contour drawing of Nicolas Cage first appeared in a rage comic uploaded to Reddit[1] by user LeechHax on October 1st, 2011. It had been vectorized by Redditor Aveilleux[10] for LeechHax to use specifically in his comic.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs.

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-are-being-forced> <https://meme4.science/about> "\"We Are Being Forced!\" (Japanese: 強いられているんだ!, Shiirarete Irunda!) is a catchphrase coined in 2011 TV anime in Gundam series Mobile Suit Gudam AGE.[1] Its cult popularity among internet users not only defined somewhat bad reputation of the anime, but also elicited a humorous reaction from the production.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-are-being-forced> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Mobile Suit Gundam AGE was aired from October 2011 to September 2012, and its production focused on getting new low-age Gundam fans. So, different from the previous titles, there were many comic-like depictions in its storylines, characters and mobile suits designs. It often became the subject of controversy among existing Gundam fans, and the anime finally didn't achieve enough commercial success as a Gundam title.In that context, the remark was uttered by Iwark Bria (イワーク・ブライア) in the 6th episode aired on November 13th, 2011. In the scene, this middle-aged guy with oddly short fat body (shown above) told the protagonists, Flit and Emily, with a detached tone about their hard life forced by pointless ideologies of people on topside in their space colony. Shortly after, he suddenly uttered the remark along with saturated linework.TranscriptThis combination of Iwark's serious remark, quite eager look and strange body shape, and sudden comic-like saturated linework effect in inappropriate timing gave a strong feeling of strangeness to viewers. Furthermore, his ridiculousness was so much emphasized by his foolhardy attack to battle mobile suits by unstylish work mobile suit \"Desperado\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-are-being-forced> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Because of this ridiculous storyline and rendition, both Iwark himself and his remark \"We Are Being Forced!\" soon became to laughing stocks on internet communities.It started by Futaba Channel (2chan) user's huge amount of parody photo collages/gif animations mocking at Iwark's odd body shape, 2channel users immediately made Shift-JIS arts reproducing the scene, and many parody illustrarions of this scene have been posted to the illustration section in Nico Nico Douga (NND) , Nico Nico Seiga[2], and Japanese illustrators community pixiv.[3] Besides, because it was quite easy to insert this phrase in daily conversations, the phrase \"X is being forced to…\" also became to a buzz word on the Japanese web.On NND, a reprinted video of this scene has earned hundreds of thousands of page views.[4] Iwark has been reused in many parody and MAD videos.[5] And a NND user developed augmented reality program realizing \"We Are Being Forced!\" by automatic facial recognition system (shown below, left). This funny invention was reported by Kotaku JAPAN on January 22nd, 2012.[6] Besides, Japanese adult video game Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai![7] released in January 2012 included a homage to Iwark's remark and that (shown below, right).Several photo retouch apps featuring saturated linework were released with the name \"We Are Being Forced! Camera\" in both Japanese App Store and Android Market.[8][9]However, this online phenomena is hardly confirmed on YouTube because MBS/TBS, broadcasting stations for the TV anime series which are very strict to copyright infringements on video sharing services except for NND and soon delete reproduced videos from there. Their another visual contents, K-ON!, is also being forced to live under the same situation.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/raimiposting> <https://meme4.science/about> "Raimiposting or Raimi-posting refers to an act of misquoting dialogue from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy in a prejudiced or insensitive manner, usually from the perspective of a moviegoer shocked by the decision to include offensive themes in a PG-13 film. Originating from 4chan's /tv/ board, the posts are often accompanied by remarks such as \"Jesus Christ, Raimi\" or \"It was a different time\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/raimiposting> <https://meme4.science/origin> "On May 3rd, 2002, superhero film Spider-Man [1] directed by Sam Raimi premiered in the cinemas, followed by the sequels Spider-Man 2 [2] in 2004 and Spider-Man 3 [3] in 2007. The films followed adventures of the high-school student Peter Parker who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and develops superhuman abilities, becoming a superhero named Spider-Man.In one scene of the first film, Spider-Man mocks his opponent Bonesaw by commenting on his outfit with a gay joke.On March 21st, 2014, an anonymous 4chan[4] user posted the quote to /tv/ board, with several commenters pointing out that the quip would cause outrage if Spider-man was released in 2014 due to the joke's homophobic nature. Through 2014 and 2015, the argument received further support in multiple /tv/ threads[5][6][7][8], while on April 22nd, 2014, the joke was labeled \"racist\" by CinemaSins[9] YouTube channel.In one such thread launched on January 17th, 2016, an anonymous user provided a complex analysis of the phrase, reversing the message in the joke[10].On January 27th, 2016, an anonymous 4chan[11] user writing under the nickname Sudowoodo posted a more offensive version of the quote in a /tv/ thread, giving the start to the Raimiposting trend.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/raimiposting> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Through 2016 and 2017, multiple threads and replies in which Spider-Man trilogy dialogs were misquoted in an offensive manner were posted on the /tv/ board[12][13][14][15], with many examples later resurging on the /r/4chan subreddit. In the quotes, Spider-man characters such as Peter Parker, Uncle Ben, Aunt May, Norman Osborn, Doctor Octopus, J. Jonah Jameson and others were presented as homophobic, racist or sociopathic. While the misquotes were usually written in a greentext format, the posts commonly ended with a brief comment in which the poster expressed shock and disgust at Sam Raimi's decision to include offensive dialogue in the films.The word \"Raimi-posting\" was first used by an anonymous 4chan[16] user in the thread launched on March 1st, 2016.".
