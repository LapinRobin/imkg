<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cyberbullying> <https://meme4.science/about> "Cyberbullying is the act of using the internet, social media and related technologies to harass a specific individual or group in a deliberate, repeated and hostile manner. With more people falling victim to cyberbullying every year, a series of legislative efforts and awareness campaigns have arisen to combat the phenomenon.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cyberbullying> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Discussion of online harassment and defamation has taken place since as early as 1996, when Canadian lawyers David Potts and Sally Harris presented a paper titled Defamation on the Internet[7] at the Legal Issues on the Internet conference on May 14th, 1996. The term \"cyberbullying\" was coined by Canadian teacher and public speaker Bill Belsey[1], who launched cyberbullying.ca[3] on March 3rd, 2003 in conjunction with the anti-bullying website he launched three years prior, bullying.org.[4] In an interview with the Huffington Post[5], Belsey explained that he launched the site after bullying.org began receiving stories about students who were being harassed online.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cyberbullying> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On March 29th, 2003, The Kingston Whig-Standard newspaper published the first article on Cyberbullying[6], citing the case of a student in Ontario whose classmates created a website to anonymously share hateful messages about him. In May 2004, Macleans Canada published an article[11] about the cyberbullying experienced by Ghyslain Raza after a video of him known as \"Star Wars Kid\" went viral online. The experience led him to seek counseling while his family launched a lawsuit against those harassing him.In November 2004, privacy lawyer Parry Aftab[8] launched NetBullies.com.[10] In February 2005, Aftab also launched the first American cyberbullying prevention program, StopCyberbullying.org[9], which encourages victims to step away from the computer, block their harasser and tell an adult about the situation. In April 2005, The Cyberbullying Research Center[12] was created to monitor and track bullying trends in schools. They posted data in 2013 that revealed an average of 23.9% of middle school students had been a victim of online harassment between 2007 and 2011.On June 27th, 2007, the Pew Internet and American Life Project released their first report on Cyberbullying[13], where they found that 32% of the teenagers polled that went online regularly had been cyberbullied. As reports of suicides caused by cyberbulling began to emerge in late 2007, it began to gain more news media attention, with stories on the phenomenon appearing in the New York Times[18] and on NPR.[19] In May 2008, the first federal law against cyberbullying was proposed to the House by Californian Rep. Linda Sánchez and Missourian Rep. Kenny Hulshof[20], but it did not receive traction.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/derp> <https://meme4.science/about> "Derp is an expression associated with stupidity, much like the earlier forms of interjections like \"duh\" and \"dur.\" In image macros, the subject is typically portrayed with eyes that are pointed to each side and a caption that reads \"DERP.\" The words \"herp\" and \"derp\" are often used in rage comics to replace nondescript names or parts of conversation. See also: Are You a Wizard.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/derp> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The first known instance of the word \"derp\" comes from the 1998 comedy film Baseketball by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. During a scene where they are caught smelling underwear taken from a woman's private drawer, Matt runs out of the room and says \"Derp.\"The South Park episode \"The Succubus\" originally aired on April 21st, 1999 introduced a character named Mr. Derp, who briefly served as the chef's replacement.[1] In this episode, the character performs various slapstick clichés like striking himself on the head with a hammer while exclaiming \"Derp!\" The expression has been used in a number of other South Park episodes, most notably in Season 6, Episode 15 \"The Biggest Douche in the Universe\" (2002) and Season 8th, Episode 6 \"They Took Our Jobs (2004).\"The use of the term in the early 2000s was dominated by the influence of South Park episodes, as evident through a number of tribute YTMND sites that were uploaded as early as in May 2004.[6] The image macros captioned \"Derp\" were first seen on 4chan's /b/ (random) board circa July 2006,[7] according to Encyclopedia Dramatica's entry on the series (said entry is no longer on the site). Prior to the emergence of \"derp,\" other indecipherable phrases have been used for reverse-captioning threads such as fgsfds and hurr durr.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/derp> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On Urban Dictionary[4], there are a total of 31 entry submissions defining the word \"Derp,\" with the earliest instance dating back to May 21st, 2003. Several entries credit Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the coinage of the term, as shown in the 1998 film Baseketball.The influence of \"derp\" continued to grow on 4chan through captioned image macros and the term became increasingly used as a non-descriptive placeholder in its text form. Initially, the practice was limited to the basic pairing of an appropriate image and the caption \"derp\", but it soon evolved into wordplays on the names of celebrity subjects depicted in the macros.In addition, the parody of Rob Schneider's movie trailer in \"The Biggest Douche in the Universe\" was particularly well received among the fans. The \"Derp\" soundbite became widely used for Derprolling, a bait-and-switch linking practice, on 4chan's imageboards and elsewhere beginning in May 2007. A Memebase[2] site for Derp derivatives was launched on June 20th, 2010. A Facebook[5] fan page has 25,662 likes as of August 22nd, 2011.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lemon-party> <https://meme4.science/about> "Lemon Party (domain: lemonparty.org) is a shock site displaying an image of three elderly males in a bed kissing and performing oral sex. It is commonly used as a bait-and-switch link by trolls in discussion forums and imageboard communities.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lemon-party> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The domain name Lemonparty.org was registered on October 3rd, 2002 in Canada,[18] according to DomainTools.[1] The entire site consisted of the pornographic image set to the 1963 doo-wop song \"If You Wanna Be Happy\" by Jimmy Soul. As early as November 21st that same year, the site[2] was updated with a hyperlink to a picture of a cat which read \"omfg crazy! Click here to wash your eyeballs!\"".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lemon-party> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Similar to other shock sites that began circulating around the same time, Lemon Party gained much of its notoriety through usage in bait-and-switch pranks among friends as well as trolling on various online discussion forums.[16] The site made \"lemon party\" into a mainstream term for elderly people having gay sex, and has since sometimes been criticized as homophobic shock humor.[19] One of the most widespread schemes used to trick people into visiting the site involves sending flyers with misleading messages, often of a political nature so that unsuspecting targets would believe they were navigating to the site of a political party (shown below). The earliest Urban Dictionary[12][13] definition of \"Lemon Party\" was submitted by user DynamiteRave on August 15th, 2004.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/no-rage-face> <https://meme4.science/about> "The No. face is a rage comic character that is used to dismiss or disapprove of another person’s idea. When in a comment, it is sometimes used as a standalone reaction image in a similar context to other negative rage faces like 'Are You Serious' face, the 'Yao Ming' face as well as the 'Are You F**king Kidding Me' face.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/no-rage-face> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The drawing was created for use on the forums of Cheat Engine, an open source game modifier. Chris Farral, better known by his handle Up2Admin[1], shared the first production of the image on August 10th, 2010[2] in the site's art sub-forum after having finished it. One of the earliest comics utilizing the face was shared on Memebase[4] on December 5th, 2010.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/no-rage-face> <https://meme4.science/spread> "The face was allegedly used throughout the Cheat Engine forum before it began appearing on Reddit[12], 4chan's /b/ (random), Facebook, and various miscellaneous blogs. It was added to the rage comic character repository All The Rage Faces[11] on August 6th, 2011. It was used on humor blog Me Gusta Memes[5] for the first time on September 17th, 2011, followed by an appearance on Funny Pictures Blog[6] five days later. On September 23rd, 2011, Farral re-uploaded the image to DeviantArt[3], noting that he had seen the face begin to go viral and wanted to share it somewhere outside of the forums before another person tried to take credit for it.In December 2011, it was included in a rage face post on IGN forums[7]. A Facebook fan page[8] was created for the face in November 2011, which has 145 likes as of June 12th, 2012. Comics with 'No.' are shared on Tumblr under the tags \"no rage face\"[9] and \"no meme\".[10]".

Tsoukalos, who often tends to explain inexplicable phenomena as the direct result of aliens or extraterrestrials being on Earth. In a somewhat similar fashion to Bill O'Reilly's You Can't Explain That series, the Ancient Aliens macros exaggerate Tsoukalos' beliefs to such an extent that they become humourous.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ancient-aliens> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The still shot of Giorgio A. Tsoukalos originated from the History Channel series Ancient Aliens[1], a documentary series that explores the possibility that aliens may have visited in the past. The program is directed and produced by Giorgio A. Tsoukalos and first aired on April 20th, 2010.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ancient-aliens> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Giorgio A. Tsoukalos's unworldly appearance and predictable resort to aliens in explaining various mysteries of human civilization caught many people's attention in the audience. As early as in November 2010, his \"alien\" repertoire became a popular subject of lulzy mockeries when it reached 4chan's /b/ (random) board[3], spawning a steady stream of images centered around an exploitable screenshot of Giorgio A. Tsoukalos from the TV series.The image macros generally poke fun at Tsoukalos' supposed obsession with \"Ancient Astronaut Theory,\" featuring text that puts forth a question about a well-known mystery like the Egyptian pyramids, the answer to which is always aliens.The propagation of Ancient Aliens series was further aided by a number of image macro application sites including MemeGenerator[4], Quickmeme[5], DIYLOL[6] and Troll.me[7] among others. Beginning in mid-2011, the image macro series began to pick up momentum on several popular hubsites such as 4chan[8], Reddit[9], and Tumblr[10].Since gaining a solid following on 4chan's /b/, Ancient Alien image macros have also spread to related forums like /x/ (paranormal), /sci/[11] (science & math) and /tv/ (television) boards where they're often used with intent to start a tireless debate or threadjack by bringing up the Ancient Astronaut Theory.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure.

In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images.

They can be used to depict the mood of the author or to influence how the reader interprets the surrounding text. Since their introduction in the early 1990s, emoticons have evolved from simple smiley faces (denoted as :-) ) to compound expressions that consist of characters from other languages and graphical images known as emoji.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/origin> "ASCII Art, or the concept of turning letters and characters into pictures, has been around since at least 1966. However, the earliest known iteration of ASCII-based facial expression is the smiley face (represented as \":-)\" to indicate sarcasm in the preceding statement) as proposed by ARPANET user Kevin MacKenzie[7] via MsgGroup mailing list on April 12th, 1979. The earliest recorded usage of the smiley face has been attributed to a post written by Scott Fahlman, submitted after a three day long discussion[18] on the Carnegie Mellon University computer science general message board about jokes and how to distinguish humor online:Fahlman took credit for inventing the “:-)” and “:-(” emoticons on his website.[8] Decades later, Fahlman stated in an April 2001 interview[9] that he created the smiley to better understand his peers, whose sarcasm on the message board was sometimes misread due to the lack of facial expressions or tone of voice. Meanwhile, the term “Emoticon,” a blending of the words “emotion” and “icon,” appeared in print publications for the first time in the New York Times on January 28th, 1990 and added to the Oxford English Dictionary (shown below) in its June 2001 print edition, followed by the first Urban Dictionary[1] definition submitted on October 1, 2002.".

Though the fonts, which turn letters into glyphs, shapes and small pictures, were not necessarily meant to be used as emoticons, many AOL users used them to decorate their profiles.[41]In the spring of 1991, author David W. Sanderson shared a list of smilies with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who began hosting it on their website.[21] This compilation of 650 emoticons was turned into a book[22] published six years later. In 1992, Internet enthusiast James Marshall also began compiling a list of smilies on his personal website.[12] As of 2008, he had collected 2,231 different smileys. The first book on emoticons, titled Smiley Dictionary: Cool Things to Do with Your Keyboard[23] by author Seth Godin, was published in January 1993.".

The Spear-Danes in days gone by.\")One of the first relevant Urban Dictionary[1] definitions was submitted by user Age on April 21st, 2003:According to Encyclopedia Dramatica, colloquial use of the term \"wat\" originated from the Something Awful forums, specifically in the FYAD (F**k You and Die) sub-community.

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/2-girls-1-cup> <https://meme4.science/about> "2 Girls 1 Cup is the colloquial name for the trailer for the Brazilian scat coprophagic fetish adult film Hungry Bitches made by MFX Media in 2007. In the clip, two women defecate into a cup and take turns consuming the cup's contents, before vomiting into each other's mouths. The extremely graphic nature of the clip, as well as the soundtrack accompaniment of \"Lovers Theme\" by Hervé Roy, caused it to go viral in late 2007, with many internet users posting their own or others' reactions to seeing the video for the first time. This phenomenon received significant attention from the media.As a result, 2girls1cup.com, hosting the most viewed mirror of the trailer, would become one of the most famous shock sites in internet history. The name, \"2 Girls 1 Cup\" has also been subject to parody, exemplified in shock sites such as 3Guys1Hammer.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/2-girls-1-cup> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Brazilian distributor and pornographer Marco Fiorito directed Hungry Bitches and his company MFX Media released the film on January 5th, 2007. Fiorito, a self-described \"compulsive fetishist,\" came under fire from United States authorities, calling his films obscene. On his films, Fiorito said, \"I have already made fetish movies with scat/feces using chocolate instead of feces. Many actors make scat films, but they don't agree to eat feces.\"[1]Months after the film's release, on August 12th, 2007, the website 2girls1cup.com launched. The site hosted the video until the site's deactivation.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/2-girls-1-cup> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Within one month of the site's launch, more than 400,000 people visited the site, spending less than 30 seconds online. The following month, that number jumped to 2 million visits. Between December 2007 and January 2008, the site received more than 8 million visits.On August 29th, 2007, Urban Dictionary [3] user DeeZeal defined the video, \"One of the most disgusting videos on the internet. It makes goatse and tubgirl look mainstream by comparison. The video features two girls enjoying one cup. And by enjoying I mean tastefully defecating into it, licking it, pucking in it and then into each other's mouths. The sickest viral video on the net, hands down!\" The post received more than 4,000 upvotes in less than 14 years (shown below).Over the next few months, the video began growing in popularity online, particularly because of reaction videos that feature people watching the film. On September 21st, 2007, YouTuber fartenewt posted one of the earliest reaction videos, receiving more than 14 million views in less than 14 years (shown below, left).\"2 Girls 1 Cup's\" viral success also led internet users to explore even more disturbing shock videos (the most famous of these being \"Pain Olympics\"), and posting similar reactions to them.By November, reaction videos were going viral on YouTube. On November 3rd, YouTuber Jame Andy posted a reaction video that received more than 22 million views in less than 14 years (shown below, right).The viral success of the video also inspired numerous parodies and other comedic content based on the clip. On November 1st, comedian Jon Lajoie, best known for his role on the television series The League, published a parody song about the video. Within 14 years, the post received more than 14 million views (shown below).On August 10th, 2010, the creator of the 2girls1cup website participated in a Reddit [2]AMA. In their introduction, the unnamed owner of the site says that they saw the video on a messageboard and created a single-use site that would auto-play the clip. After the first month, they said that they forgot they had hosted the video, but after being charged by the hosting company due to overage charges, they saw the steady success of the page.As the site reached its peak, they decided to sell the 2girls1cup.com because they \"had been cut from all revenue sources due to the site nature and were losing money quick, we were barely breaking even for server costs and all the other good stuff.\" They sold the site in February 2008.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trolling-troll> <https://meme4.science/about> "Troll or Trolling is a slang term used to describe any internet user or their behavior that is meant to intentionally anger or frustrate someone else, though not to be confused with cyberbullying, a form of online harassment carried out against an individual in a deliberately hostile manner (often without any reason) or pranking, which similarly involves playing jokes on strangers for one's amusement (but typically implies more coordination and intent).".

It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure.

The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

When the site was first archived[9] in October 2008, 180 rules existed. As of June 2012, the site lists rules numbering in the 900s.

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/about> "Emoticons are pictorial representations of facial expressions created with a mix of punctuation marks and letters. They can be used to depict the mood of the author or to influence how the reader interprets the surrounding text. Since their introduction in the early 1990s, emoticons have evolved from simple smiley faces (denoted as :-) ) to compound expressions that consist of characters from other languages and graphical images known as emoji.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/origin> "ASCII Art, or the concept of turning letters and characters into pictures, has been around since at least 1966. However, the earliest known iteration of ASCII-based facial expression is the smiley face (represented as \":-)\" to indicate sarcasm in the preceding statement) as proposed by ARPANET user Kevin MacKenzie[7] via MsgGroup mailing list on April 12th, 1979. The earliest recorded usage of the smiley face has been attributed to a post written by Scott Fahlman, submitted after a three day long discussion[18] on the Carnegie Mellon University computer science general message board about jokes and how to distinguish humor online:Fahlman took credit for inventing the “:-)” and “:-(” emoticons on his website.[8] Decades later, Fahlman stated in an April 2001 interview[9] that he created the smiley to better understand his peers, whose sarcasm on the message board was sometimes misread due to the lack of facial expressions or tone of voice. Meanwhile, the term “Emoticon,” a blending of the words “emotion” and “icon,” appeared in print publications for the first time in the New York Times on January 28th, 1990 and added to the Oxford English Dictionary (shown below) in its June 2001 print edition, followed by the first Urban Dictionary[1] definition submitted on October 1, 2002.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 1990, a series of three dingbat[39] fonts known as Wingdings[40] were incorporated into Microsoft Windows. Though the fonts, which turn letters into glyphs, shapes and small pictures, were not necessarily meant to be used as emoticons, many AOL users used them to decorate their profiles.[41]In the spring of 1991, author David W. Sanderson shared a list of smilies with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who began hosting it on their website.[21] This compilation of 650 emoticons was turned into a book[22] published six years later. In 1992, Internet enthusiast James Marshall also began compiling a list of smilies on his personal website.[12] As of 2008, he had collected 2,231 different smileys. The first book on emoticons, titled Smiley Dictionary: Cool Things to Do with Your Keyboard[23] by author Seth Godin, was published in January 1993.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another.[2] A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

In the decade since its release, it became the subject of widespread mockery among its readers, and has since been widely parodied in minimalist interpretations of the strip's four panels, represented as \"| || || |_\".".

Something Awful users were particularly unkind to the comic, creating mock threads[12][13] (one of which is over 350 pages long), two entire (now closed) wikis and an interactive graph of the comic.[14] Someone went to the extent of making a random CAD comic generator,[15] subtly mocking that even disjointed, mismatched panels of the comic are still funnier than the originals.El Santo[16] (the webcomic overlook), The Bad Webcomic Wiki[17] and others have also mentioned the infamous comic in negative reviews of the webcomic as well. On July 25th, 2009, YouTuber KennylovesArin uploaded a musical tribute based on the comic accompanied by friends Skraggy and Arin (popular animator known as Egoraptor), with lyrical references to the miscarriage strip.".

However, the barrel roll maneuver was later included as a move in the Super Nintendo console game Star Fox that was released in the U.S. in the spring of 1993. In the game, the player could perform a barrel roll by double-tapping the L and R buttons, protecting the ship from enemy lasers.The specific phrase \"do a barrel roll\" that's referenced in memes comes from the sequel Star Fox 64, released on June 30th, 1997, in which the character Peppy Hare (voiced by Rick May) orders you to \"do a barrel roll!\" while approaching four stationary turrets firing lasers in the game. On June 4th, 2007, YouTuber[9] DeusExBenigma uploaded the earliest known and highest-viewed video of this scene and meme, receiving over 5.9 million views, 32,000 likes and 4,700 comments in roughly 15 years (seen below).".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/about> "Emoticons are pictorial representations of facial expressions created with a mix of punctuation marks and letters. They can be used to depict the mood of the author or to influence how the reader interprets the surrounding text. Since their introduction in the early 1990s, emoticons have evolved from simple smiley faces (denoted as :-) ) to compound expressions that consist of characters from other languages and graphical images known as emoji.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/origin> "ASCII Art, or the concept of turning letters and characters into pictures, has been around since at least 1966. However, the earliest known iteration of ASCII-based facial expression is the smiley face (represented as \":-)\" to indicate sarcasm in the preceding statement) as proposed by ARPANET user Kevin MacKenzie[7] via MsgGroup mailing list on April 12th, 1979. The earliest recorded usage of the smiley face has been attributed to a post written by Scott Fahlman, submitted after a three day long discussion[18] on the Carnegie Mellon University computer science general message board about jokes and how to distinguish humor online:Fahlman took credit for inventing the “:-)” and “:-(” emoticons on his website.[8] Decades later, Fahlman stated in an April 2001 interview[9] that he created the smiley to better understand his peers, whose sarcasm on the message board was sometimes misread due to the lack of facial expressions or tone of voice. Meanwhile, the term “Emoticon,” a blending of the words “emotion” and “icon,” appeared in print publications for the first time in the New York Times on January 28th, 1990 and added to the Oxford English Dictionary (shown below) in its June 2001 print edition, followed by the first Urban Dictionary[1] definition submitted on October 1, 2002.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 1990, a series of three dingbat[39] fonts known as Wingdings[40] were incorporated into Microsoft Windows. Though the fonts, which turn letters into glyphs, shapes and small pictures, were not necessarily meant to be used as emoticons, many AOL users used them to decorate their profiles.[41]In the spring of 1991, author David W. Sanderson shared a list of smilies with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who began hosting it on their website.[21] This compilation of 650 emoticons was turned into a book[22] published six years later. In 1992, Internet enthusiast James Marshall also began compiling a list of smilies on his personal website.[12] As of 2008, he had collected 2,231 different smileys. The first book on emoticons, titled Smiley Dictionary: Cool Things to Do with Your Keyboard[23] by author Seth Godin, was published in January 1993.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/slender-man> <https://meme4.science/about> "Slender Man (a.k.a Slenderman) is a mythical creature often depicted as a tall, thin figure wearing a black suit and a blank face. According to the legend, he can stretch or shorten his arms at will and has tentacle-like appendages protruding from his back. Depending on the interpretations of the myth, the creature may cause memory loss, insomnia, paranoia, coughing fits (nicknamed \"slendersickness\"), photograph/video distortions and can teleport at will. The urban legend has inspired fan arts, fictional creepypastas and a mockumentary series in the style of the 1999 indie horror film Blair Witch Project. As the character has grown in popularity, he's gained a number of other nicknames including The Operator, Der Großmann, Mr. Slim, The Administrator, Daddy LongLegs, Mr. Thin, The Tall Man, The Thin Man and Slendy.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/slender-man> <https://meme4.science/origin> "On June 8th, 2009, a \"'paranormal pictures\" photoshop contest was launched on the Something Awful (SA) Forums.[1] The contest required participants to turn ordinary photographs into creepy-looking images through digital manipulation and then pass them on as authentic photographs on a number of paranormal forums. Something Awful users soon began sharing their faux-paranormal creations with layered images of ghosts and other anomalies, usually accompanied by a fabricated witness account to make them more convincing. On June 10th, SA user Victor Surge (real name Eric Knudsen) posted two black and white photographs of unnamed children with a short description of \"Slender Man\" as a mysterious creature who stalked children.[2]On June 11th, 2009, Victor Surge continued to improve upon the myth by adding another picture and a fake doctor's account.[3] The following day, SA user LeechCode5[4] posted a photograph of a burning building with a Slender Man back story. On June 14th, SA goon TrenchMaul[6] reused the Slender Man character for his own story. The original thread, which still remains active today, extends for 46 pages as of June 2011.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/slender-man> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Slender Man became a well-known mythical creature on the /x/ (paranormal) 4chan board.[7] The earliest known mention of \"Slender Man\" on 4chan can be found in an archived thread dating back to June 24th, 2009, though the conversation suggests that it had been mentioned prior. The image was coupled with hand-drawn illustrations and fanart.Outside of 4chan, Slender Man has caught the attention of several websites including the Unfiction Forums[8], Fangoria[9], Bungie,[10] Facepunch,[11] Wikibin,[12] /x/enopedia,[13] TVTropes,[14] Kongregate,[15] DeviantArt,[16] SlenderNation,[17] and Mythical Creatures Guide.[18]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

In recent years, some authors have re-appropriated the genre into an effective pretext for bait-and-switch trolling.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "While folklores have been an essential part of cultural traditions for many centuries, the term \"urban legend\" began appearing in print publications as early as 1968 and became widespread through a series of books written by English professor Jan Harold Brunvand in the early 1980s. Since then, the word has become closely associated with short horror or mystery stories set in modern day. Starting in the 1990s, chain letter e-mails quickly emerged as the primary medium for sharing such stories on the Internet. [1]The Internet slang term \"creepypasta,\" which is derived from copypasta, did not enter the 4chan community's vernacular until mid-2007, with the earliest known archived thread[2] dating back to July 6th.".

The term is an English portmanteau of \"copy,\" \"paste\" and \"pasta.\" Although it shares some characteristics with spam in the sense they're both unsolicited (and often considered a nuisance), copypastas are mainly spread through human operators whereas the latter is automatically generated by electronic messaging systems.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "This simple concept of \"manually copying text from one place and pasting it elsewhere\" has been in practice since the innovation of basic text-editing commands (copy/cut/paste) in the early 1980s and subsequent rise of spamming in the early 1990s. In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of \"cut and paste\" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1]The origin of the term \"copypasta\" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, \"An amount of lengthy text that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to an irrelevant subject.\" The post received more than 170 upvotes in less than 15 years (shown below).".

In the image macro series, the character is depicted as a highly charismatic and well-traveled gentleman with refined tastes in many things, much like the nameless bearded man originally portrayed in the campaign, often accompanied by captions based on the phrasal template \"I don't always X, but when I do, I Y.\"".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-most-interesting-man-in-the-world> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The advertising campaign was created by the global marketing firm Euro RSCG Worldwide.[2] The ads starred American actor Jonathan Goldsmith[3] as “the most interesting man” with narration by Will Lyman[4], best known for his narrating role in the public affairs TV program Frontline. Goldsmith's character is known for his catchphrases \"I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis,\" and \"Stay thirsty, my friends.\"The ads first aired in the United States in 2006 and were uploaded to the wistl1976 YouTube[15] channel on April 10th, 2007. The same month, the promotional website StayThirstyMyFriends.com[6] was launched, where fans could upload videos of themselves performing toasts with a bottle of Dos Equis.".

On April 24th, 2008, a thread was posted about the campaign on the Texas Longhorns enthusiast HornsFans[16] forums, in which forum member wolfman compared Goldsmith's character to the martial artist Chuck Norris.On May 25th, 2009, the news blog Slate[10] published an article, claiming the ads took \"aesthetic cues\" from the work of film director Wes Anderson. On June 4th, the food blog Eat Me Daily[5] posted about the campaign, remarking that the character had its own Twitter-impersonator (the Twitter[17] account has since been deleted). On July 2nd, People Magazine[11] interviewed Jonathan Goldsmith, who revealed he lived on a 47-foot boat in California. An archived 4chan[19] post with racist versions of the Goldsmith character dates back to August 3rd. The Internet Wayback Machine's[18] first snapshot of the Meme Generator[1] page for \"Most Interesting Man in the World\" was taken on November 22nd. The page allowed users to created image macros using a photo of the Goldsmith as the Dos Equis man. In January of 2010, a Quickmeme page for \"The Most Interesting Man in the World\" was created, in which the first image macro was captioned with \"I don't masturbate often / but when I do, I use women.\"On February 11th, Vitamin Water began a parody campaign called \"The Most Ridiculous Man in the World\" featuring Canadian basketball player Steve Nash. In the videos, Nash is portrayed as a bizarre character who says the catchphrase \"I don't always drink water, but when I do, it's Vitamin Water\" and \"Stay vitaminized, my friends.\" As of April 10th, 2012, a Quickmeme[13] page has over 96,000 submissions and a Facebook[14] page has received over 243,000 likes.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dank-memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "\"Dank Memes\" is an ironic expression used to describe online viral media and in-jokes that are intentionally bizarre or have exhausted their comedic value to the point of being trite or cliché.[5] In this context, the word “dank,” originally coined as a term for high quality marijuana, is satirically used as a synonym for “cool.”".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dank-memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The exact origin of the phrase \"dank memes\" is unknown. Many have speculated that it was coined on the /s4s/ (shit 4chan says) board on 4chan, /r/2007scape on Reddit or within the montage parody community on YouTube.[1]".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dank-memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On May 26th, 2013, YouTuber fennthulhu uploaded a parody video titled \"How 2 make dank memes!\", in which he demonstrates how to create an edgy Success Kid image macro on the website Quickmeme (shown below, left).

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

In May 2010, a variations thread appeared on 4chan[6], in which people posted photos with matching phrases based on the phrasal template \"X-ers are gonna X.\" On January 25th, 2012, \"Haters Gonna Hate\" was chosen as the Urban Word of the Day.[10]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Ironic Memes are memes that are used satirically, usually by being deliberately humorless, crude or overused, as a way to both criticize meme or meme elitism cultures. Ironic memes often spawn as a response to overuse with time, usually due to \"The Family Guy Effect,\" as well as to simply catch those with less internet experience off guard. The use of ironic memes often includes intentional overuse of older internet phenomena, like 1337 speak or Rage Comics, as well as the use of the word \"meme\" as a replacement for some parts of speech, such as nouns or verbs. Ironic memes trace back to roughly mid-2008 and were popularized on platforms like 4chan, YouTube and Reddit.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Although the exact first use of the term \"ironic meme\" online is unknown, the ironic fandom of Disney's Cory in the House beginning in mid-2008 with the remix video \"Top 27 Anime Boobs,\" uploaded on August 23rd, 2008, by YouTuber[1] TheSaltySaltySalt, serves as one of the earliest known examples of an ironic meme (shown below). Spawned from a running joke that referred to Cory in the House as an anime, this early ironic meme was originally created on 4chan's /v/ board and became the source of a tongue-in-cheek running gag following the release of a video game for the Nintendo DS based on the series. This video was first uploaded in 2007 but was deleted and reuploaded afterward, accumulating over 875,000 views, 5,700 likes, 3,500 dislikes and 1,700 comments in roughly 12 and a half years.Photoshopped images of Cory and screenshots of the various dialogue screens from the game were widespread in early ironic meme culture, while the game itself was constantly used as a way of trolling whenever the leak of a new game was asked and as an ironic response in \"favorite videogame\" threads.[2] This ironic humor then spread to Reddit shortly after, particularly to the /r/gaming and /r/askreddit subreddits.[3]".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On September 15th, 2008, the gimmick Twitter account Dril posted its first tweet with simply \"no\" as the only text, serving as an early precursor to ironic meme humor on Twitter.[5]On April 16th, 2009, YouTuber[4] Richalvarez uploaded a Super Mario parody of Smash Mouth's \"All Star,\" titled \"Mario, You're a Plumber,\" which subsequently spawned another ironic fandom in early ironic meme culture. The video went on to garner over 1.6 million views, 13,000 likes and 2,700 comments in about 12 years (seen below).On April 1st, 2013, the online imageboard 4chan launched the /s4s/ (shit 4chan says) board, an April Fool's Day joke imageboard created entirely for nonsensical shitposting. Despite this original purpose, the board was kept online after April Fool's Day. Besides hosting nonsensical posts, the board, also focuses on making \"memes\" out of things that otherwise would not be considered memetic material.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another.[2] A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pedobear> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The character known today as Pedobear used to be simply known as \"Kumar\" or \"Kumā\" (bear) on the Japanese textboard 2channel. It originated as an ASCII art image created by ぶる ~ 3, who was instrumental in starting an emoticon-only board on 2ch.[1] One of the earliest 2ch threads with this ASCII was posted on February 27th, 2003.[2] The bear would be posted as a reaction to threads where the original poster would be fishing for attention, as a way to highlight the thread was an obvious troll.[3]The ASCII character gradually evolved to encompass several lines instead of just one, before becoming a drawn character[4], popular enough to be turned into papercraft.[5]".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pedobear> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Due to 4chan's anonymous environment, people tend to act without fear of retribution. Because of this, there are the occasional pedophiles swapping Child Pornography, or CP on the site.Pedobear had become associated with pedophilia as early as February 2005 when it was defined on Urban Dictionary[6] as a character used on hentai “lolikon” [sic] boards and on 4chan. Some of the earliest threads with Pedobear photoshopped into photos of young girls date back to February 10th, 2006, archived via screenshot, and November 29th, 2006.[7]Pedobear.org[12] was created on January 14th, 2008 hosting a pedobear image gallery and shop. DesuToys has sold a Pedobear plush[14] since early 2009. Also that year, Pedobear was voted Miley Cyrus's number 1 fan.[8] In February 2010, the Times of Malta[13] reported that a graffiti artist had stenciled Pedobear on to billboards advertising the Pope's trip to Malta. The stenciler was never found, but the story about the incident brought over 300,000 readers to the Times of Malta in two months.[15] Since its appearance in the media and blog coverage, Pedobear has been frequently misinterpreted as a symbol of pedophilia.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-mandela-effect> <https://meme4.science/about> "The Mandela Effect is a slang term for the phenomenon in which a large group of people shares false memories of past events, referred to as confabulation in psychiatry.[13] Some have speculated that the memories are caused by parallel universes or alternate realities spilling into our own, while others explain the phenomenon as a failure of collective memory. The term was coined by Fiona Broome in 2010 and became an increasing subject of interest in 2012. As the concept and term became more commonplace throughout the 2010s, it became a prevalent topic around social media, as well as appearing in memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-mandela-effect> <https://meme4.science/origin> "In 2010, blogger Fiona Broome coined the term \"Mandela Effect\" to describe a collective false memory she discovered at the Dragon Con convention, where many others believed that former South African President Nelson Mandela died in prison in the 1980s during his imprisonment. That year, Broome launched the site MandelaEffect.com[1] to document various examples of the phenomenon.Additionally, Broome described other widely-held false memories beyond the belief of Mandela dying in prison, including various nonexistent Star Trek episodes and rumors about the death of the Reverend Billy Graham.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/about> "Copypasta is internet slang for any block of text that gets copied and pasted over and over again, typically disseminated by individuals through online discussion forums and social networking sites. The term is an English portmanteau of \"copy,\" \"paste\" and \"pasta.\" Although it shares some characteristics with spam in the sense they're both unsolicited (and often considered a nuisance), copypastas are mainly spread through human operators whereas the latter is automatically generated by electronic messaging systems.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "This simple concept of \"manually copying text from one place and pasting it elsewhere\" has been in practice since the innovation of basic text-editing commands (copy/cut/paste) in the early 1980s and subsequent rise of spamming in the early 1990s. In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of \"cut and paste\" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1]The origin of the term \"copypasta\" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, \"An amount of lengthy text that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to an irrelevant subject.\" The post received more than 170 upvotes in less than 15 years (shown below).".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On September 9th, 2009, Redditor Null_Slate launched the /r/copypasta[3] subreddit. Attracting more than 78,000 users in less than 12 years, the subreddit allows users to share text to various copypasta templates.Nearly a decade later, on September 14th, 2018, Merriam Webster's Dictionary[4] considered \"copypasta\" in their \"Words We're Watching\" series.

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards.

In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images.

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another.[2] A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kek> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The term has its origins in the Korean language, as the onomatopoeia ㅋㅋㅋ, in which ㅋ stands for the \"k\" sounds, like in raspy, stifled laughter. In the real-time strategy game Starcraft, because the game originally did not support the Korean language, the onomatopoeia was written as \"Kekeke\" which can be translated to \"Hahaha\" in English.In the online multiplayer role-playing game WoW, released on November 23rd, 2004, players can choose to play on either the Alliance or Horde factions, which are considered enemies within the game's universe. Players of separate factions are unable to communicate with one-another, as their typed text is run through an in-game translator. For players of the Horde faction, typing the letters \"LOL\" results in members of the Alliance faction reading \"KEK\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kek> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On March 22nd, 2005, Urban Dictionary[1] user drat submitted an entry for the word “kek,” defining it as “'lol' in Orcish.” On June 19th, 2007, Yahoo Answers[6] member Mr. Questionair submitted a question about cross-faction communication, to which user ArcadianStormcrow replied that when Horde players speak the word “lol,” it shows up as “kek” for Alliance players. On April 4th, 2008, a thread was submitted to the Gamespot Forums[7] which included mentions of “kek” and “lol” among other faction translations. On June 24th, 2009, Wow Insider[8] published an article on communicating with enemies, noting that saying “kek” as an Alliance player will not translate as “lol” to a Horde player. On February 16th, 2010, Wowhead Forums[2] member sistereinstein submitted a thread asking if “kek” was a new slang term for “LOL.” On September 2nd, 2011, an entry for “kek” was submitted to the slang website Internet Slang,[3] defining it as “LOL in WOW.”".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fap> <https://meme4.science/origin> "\"Fap\" is one of many onomatopoeic words often used in manga to depict the specific sound of a character masturbating. The earliest known transcription of the word \"fap\" online can be found in the Sexy Losers[1] webcomic titled \"Video Girl Etchi\" (shown below, left), published on April 28th, 1999. The comic parodied a scene from Video Girl Ai, a manga series written and illustrated by Masakazu Katsura and released between 1990 and 1993.[9] On July 12th, 2011, Sexy Losers' artist Clay revealed in a post[8] on Tumblr that he was inspired by a Heartbroken Angels comic strip by Masahiko Kikuni depicting God masturbating when searching for a sound representing masturbation in his own strip.".

The term is an English portmanteau of \"copy,\" \"paste\" and \"pasta.\" Although it shares some characteristics with spam in the sense they're both unsolicited (and often considered a nuisance), copypastas are mainly spread through human operators whereas the latter is automatically generated by electronic messaging systems.".

In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of \"cut and paste\" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1]The origin of the term \"copypasta\" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, \"An amount of lengthy text that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to an irrelevant subject.\" The post received more than 170 upvotes in less than 15 years (shown below).".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Ironic Memes are memes that are used satirically, usually by being deliberately humorless, crude or overused, as a way to both criticize meme or meme elitism cultures. Ironic memes often spawn as a response to overuse with time, usually due to \"The Family Guy Effect,\" as well as to simply catch those with less internet experience off guard. The use of ironic memes often includes intentional overuse of older internet phenomena, like 1337 speak or Rage Comics, as well as the use of the word \"meme\" as a replacement for some parts of speech, such as nouns or verbs. Ironic memes trace back to roughly mid-2008 and were popularized on platforms like 4chan, YouTube and Reddit.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Although the exact first use of the term \"ironic meme\" online is unknown, the ironic fandom of Disney's Cory in the House beginning in mid-2008 with the remix video \"Top 27 Anime Boobs,\" uploaded on August 23rd, 2008, by YouTuber[1] TheSaltySaltySalt, serves as one of the earliest known examples of an ironic meme (shown below). Spawned from a running joke that referred to Cory in the House as an anime, this early ironic meme was originally created on 4chan's /v/ board and became the source of a tongue-in-cheek running gag following the release of a video game for the Nintendo DS based on the series. This video was first uploaded in 2007 but was deleted and reuploaded afterward, accumulating over 875,000 views, 5,700 likes, 3,500 dislikes and 1,700 comments in roughly 12 and a half years.Photoshopped images of Cory and screenshots of the various dialogue screens from the game were widespread in early ironic meme culture, while the game itself was constantly used as a way of trolling whenever the leak of a new game was asked and as an ironic response in \"favorite videogame\" threads.[2] This ironic humor then spread to Reddit shortly after, particularly to the /r/gaming and /r/askreddit subreddits.[3]".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On September 15th, 2008, the gimmick Twitter account Dril posted its first tweet with simply \"no\" as the only text, serving as an early precursor to ironic meme humor on Twitter.[5]On April 16th, 2009, YouTuber[4] Richalvarez uploaded a Super Mario parody of Smash Mouth's \"All Star,\" titled \"Mario, You're a Plumber,\" which subsequently spawned another ironic fandom in early ironic meme culture. The video went on to garner over 1.6 million views, 13,000 likes and 2,700 comments in about 12 years (seen below).On April 1st, 2013, the online imageboard 4chan launched the /s4s/ (shit 4chan says) board, an April Fool's Day joke imageboard created entirely for nonsensical shitposting. Despite this original purpose, the board was kept online after April Fool's Day. Besides hosting nonsensical posts, the board, also focuses on making \"memes\" out of things that otherwise would not be considered memetic material.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".

Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another.[2] A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Ironic Memes are memes that are used satirically, usually by being deliberately humorless, crude or overused, as a way to both criticize meme or meme elitism cultures. Ironic memes often spawn as a response to overuse with time, usually due to \"The Family Guy Effect,\" as well as to simply catch those with less internet experience off guard. The use of ironic memes often includes intentional overuse of older internet phenomena, like 1337 speak or Rage Comics, as well as the use of the word \"meme\" as a replacement for some parts of speech, such as nouns or verbs. Ironic memes trace back to roughly mid-2008 and were popularized on platforms like 4chan, YouTube and Reddit.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Although the exact first use of the term \"ironic meme\" online is unknown, the ironic fandom of Disney's Cory in the House beginning in mid-2008 with the remix video \"Top 27 Anime Boobs,\" uploaded on August 23rd, 2008, by YouTuber[1] TheSaltySaltySalt, serves as one of the earliest known examples of an ironic meme (shown below). Spawned from a running joke that referred to Cory in the House as an anime, this early ironic meme was originally created on 4chan's /v/ board and became the source of a tongue-in-cheek running gag following the release of a video game for the Nintendo DS based on the series. This video was first uploaded in 2007 but was deleted and reuploaded afterward, accumulating over 875,000 views, 5,700 likes, 3,500 dislikes and 1,700 comments in roughly 12 and a half years.Photoshopped images of Cory and screenshots of the various dialogue screens from the game were widespread in early ironic meme culture, while the game itself was constantly used as a way of trolling whenever the leak of a new game was asked and as an ironic response in \"favorite videogame\" threads.[2] This ironic humor then spread to Reddit shortly after, particularly to the /r/gaming and /r/askreddit subreddits.[3]".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ironic-memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On September 15th, 2008, the gimmick Twitter account Dril posted its first tweet with simply \"no\" as the only text, serving as an early precursor to ironic meme humor on Twitter.[5]On April 16th, 2009, YouTuber[4] Richalvarez uploaded a Super Mario parody of Smash Mouth's \"All Star,\" titled \"Mario, You're a Plumber,\" which subsequently spawned another ironic fandom in early ironic meme culture. The video went on to garner over 1.6 million views, 13,000 likes and 2,700 comments in about 12 years (seen below).On April 1st, 2013, the online imageboard 4chan launched the /s4s/ (shit 4chan says) board, an April Fool's Day joke imageboard created entirely for nonsensical shitposting. Despite this original purpose, the board was kept online after April Fool's Day. Besides hosting nonsensical posts, the board, also focuses on making \"memes\" out of things that otherwise would not be considered memetic material.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

It is often used as a reaction image to represent feelings such as melancholy, regret or loneliness. Wojak memes as a genre have grown to include various remixes and edits to the character -- as of February 2023, a search for \"wojak\" on this site generates over 200 entries, representing the wide range and variety of wojaks that have become popular online.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wojak> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The exact origin of the Wojak illustration is unknown. On December 16th, 2009, the earliest known I Wish I Was at Home MS Paint comic was submitted to the internet humor site Sad and Useless,[9] which features the Wojak character standing in a corner at a party (shown below).According to \"ask me anything\" (AMA) thread on Reddit[1] by a user claiming to be Krautchan user Wojak, the bald man illustration was originally discovered on the imageboard Vichan with the filename \"twarz.jpg.\" The image was subsequently popularized as a reaction image after Wojak submitted it to the German language image board Krautchan, with the earliest archived post appearing on April 26th, 2010 (shown below).Soon after, the picture became known as “Wojak’s face” and “ciepła twarz” (“warm face”). The image spread to other international image boards, including the Italian Pastachan[3] and the Russian Dobrochan.In Polish, \"wojak\" translates (more or less) to \"warrior\" in English. The root of the word is \"woj-,\" and the diminutive \"-k\"suffix may indicate a certain childishness or physical smallness.[10]".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wojak> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On February 2nd, 2012, Redditor Voyack submitted an AMA to the /r/datfeel[2] subreddit, claiming to be Wojack from Krautchan. On October 3rd, 2013, the news site Bustle[6] published an article about the origins of the Feels Guy. On November 19th, a Facebook[8] page titled \"Feels Guy\" was launched, which gained over 6,400 likes in the next two years. On May 22nd, YouTuber ReluctantMisc uploaded an animated video of Wojak titled \"A day in the life of 'that feel when' guy\" (shown below).On April 2nd, 2014, a page for \"Feels Guy\" was created on the Internet culture wiki Encyclopedia Dramatica.[5] On March 14th, 2015, the /r/Wojak[7] subreddit was launched for photoshopped variations of the Feels Guy image.Going into the late 2010s, a variety of Wojak variations emerged which saw the character drift away from his chan-culture origins. \"Wojak Comics\":Wojak Comics linked the character with other famous meme characters, often using his highly emotive face as a counterpoint to the stoicism of Yes Chad and others.By 2022, a wide variety of Wojak-based meme characters had emerged -- enough that Wojaks themselves could constitute a vocabulary to articulate highly sophisticated stories and arguments. For example, Redditor u/perpetualhillman posted a 7 × 7 political compass grid meme on September 5th, 2022, representing the types of people they had met during a trip to Ukraine as the Russian war against that country unfolded. Each personality in the meme is represented by a different Wojak or Wojak-adjacent character.[11]".

In recent years, some authors have re-appropriated the genre into an effective pretext for bait-and-switch trolling.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "While folklores have been an essential part of cultural traditions for many centuries, the term \"urban legend\" began appearing in print publications as early as 1968 and became widespread through a series of books written by English professor Jan Harold Brunvand in the early 1980s. Since then, the word has become closely associated with short horror or mystery stories set in modern day. Starting in the 1990s, chain letter e-mails quickly emerged as the primary medium for sharing such stories on the Internet. [1]The Internet slang term \"creepypasta,\" which is derived from copypasta, did not enter the 4chan community's vernacular until mid-2007, with the earliest known archived thread[2] dating back to July 6th.".

In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of \"cut and paste\" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1]The origin of the term \"copypasta\" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006.

On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another.[2] A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

Although its precise meaning is unclear, the phrase has since been adopted by his fans on the live video chatting service Twitch Chat, along with its emoticon form \"ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ raise your dongers ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ.\"".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/raise-your-dongers> <https://meme4.science/origin> "According to Redditor Cosmoviking,[5] Santana would often play the LoL champion character Heimerdinger, whom he initially nicknamed \"donger.\" Santana subsequently used the phrase \"dongsquad\" as a password for his subscribers, which fans began spamming in Twitch TV along with the code-term \"420\", in a similar vein to the expression \"420 blaze it\".".

On May 24th, a T-shirt featuring an illustration of Santana with the word \"Dongsquad\" underneath (shown below) was placed for sale on the LoL player website Team-Dignitas.[6]On June 17th, Santana tweeted the message \"ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ raise your dongers,\" which received over 130 retweets and 70 favorites within the first week.On June 20th, League of Legends Forums[1] member iJamioo started a thread requesting an explanation for the meaning of \"raise your dongers.\" The same day, a Facebook[9] page titled \"ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ Raise Ur Dongersヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ\" was launched.

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/serbia-strong-remove-kebab> <https://meme4.science/about> "\"Serbia Strong\", commonly known as \"Remove Kebab\", is a propaganda music video produced by a group of four Bosnian Serb Army soldiers--a trumpet player, an accordion player, a singer and a keyboard player--as a patriotic tribute to Radovan Karadžić, the former Bosnian-Serb politician and convicted war criminal who served as the first President of Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War between 1992 and 1996. Upon entering online circulation in 2006, the music video gained much notoriety for its nationalistic tone and spawned a large volume of parody images and videos. In March 2019, a document authored by a shooter who killed 50 people at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand referred to himself as a \"kebab removalist\" in reference to the meme.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/serbia-strong-remove-kebab> <https://meme4.science/origin> "According to the keyboardist, Slobodan Vrga, the video was filmed near Knin, Croatia, in 1995 apparently by an independent producer named Nikola Jorgic. The singer, Zeljko Grmusa, also identified the site as near Knin but the year as 1993. Jorgic is featured briefly speaking into a microphone at the beginning of the earliest online instance of the music video uploaded by YouTuber ARHIVISTA on August 3rd, 2008. ARHIVISTA is the account of Croatian documentary filmmaker Pavle Vranjican who covered the Yugoslav Wars near Knin. Due to inclusion of scenes from Karadžić's 2008 trial, the clip appears to have been modified from its original source to parody the creators' intent. Vrga initially identified Nenad Tintor as the trumpeter and Grmusa as the vocalist but did not recall the name of the accordionist. Vrga later acknowledged Novislav Đajić as the accordionist. In light of the song being played prior to the Christchurch mosque shootings, both Vrga and Grmusa have condemned the shooter's actions.Tintor's life after the video remains unknown. Đajić was later indicted on 15 charges of genocide and sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment in Germany. After serving his term, he supposedly lived in Budva, Montenegro, until his apparent death in 2014, though neither the surviving members of the music video nor records have confirmed this information. Jorgic, the producer of the music video, was also indicted on charges of genocide and sentenced to life imprisonment in Germany. He died in prison in 2014 due to complications of heart disease and diabetes as confirmed by Serbian news media.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/serbia-strong-remove-kebab> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On May 24th, 2006, YouTuber Momcilo uploaded a music video titled \"Dzamije lete\" (english: Mosque Fly), which opens with edited footage from the \"Serbia Strong\" music video, garnering more than 378,000 views. Unlike the version uploaded by Vranjican, the segment lacks a watermark. The video, taken from a mock-contest for \"Best Chetnik Song,\" was broadcast on the Croatian television network Omladinska TV (OTV) during the Eurovision 2006 contest. The music video was used as a transition into \"Dzamije lete\" featuring Miro Sembermac who had published Serbian turbofolk music through the Superton label. Due to Vranjican's involvement in the OTV special, the clip likely came from the same tape source.In 2010, a music video parody of \"Serbia Strong\" titled \"Tupac Serbia\" was submitted to Krautchan's /int/ board by Sergej, a Macedonian user based in Istanbul, Turkey. Meanwhile, a copypasta text referring to this video began to spread across the Internet:".

It is often used as a reaction image to represent feelings such as melancholy, regret or loneliness. Wojak memes as a genre have grown to include various remixes and edits to the character -- as of February 2023, a search for \"wojak\" on this site generates over 200 entries, representing the wide range and variety of wojaks that have become popular online.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wojak> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The exact origin of the Wojak illustration is unknown. On December 16th, 2009, the earliest known I Wish I Was at Home MS Paint comic was submitted to the internet humor site Sad and Useless,[9] which features the Wojak character standing in a corner at a party (shown below).According to \"ask me anything\" (AMA) thread on Reddit[1] by a user claiming to be Krautchan user Wojak, the bald man illustration was originally discovered on the imageboard Vichan with the filename \"twarz.jpg.\" The image was subsequently popularized as a reaction image after Wojak submitted it to the German language image board Krautchan, with the earliest archived post appearing on April 26th, 2010 (shown below).Soon after, the picture became known as “Wojak’s face” and “ciepła twarz” (“warm face”). The image spread to other international image boards, including the Italian Pastachan[3] and the Russian Dobrochan.In Polish, \"wojak\" translates (more or less) to \"warrior\" in English. The root of the word is \"woj-,\" and the diminutive \"-k\"suffix may indicate a certain childishness or physical smallness.[10]".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wojak> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On February 2nd, 2012, Redditor Voyack submitted an AMA to the /r/datfeel[2] subreddit, claiming to be Wojack from Krautchan. On October 3rd, 2013, the news site Bustle[6] published an article about the origins of the Feels Guy. On November 19th, a Facebook[8] page titled \"Feels Guy\" was launched, which gained over 6,400 likes in the next two years. On May 22nd, YouTuber ReluctantMisc uploaded an animated video of Wojak titled \"A day in the life of 'that feel when' guy\" (shown below).On April 2nd, 2014, a page for \"Feels Guy\" was created on the Internet culture wiki Encyclopedia Dramatica.[5] On March 14th, 2015, the /r/Wojak[7] subreddit was launched for photoshopped variations of the Feels Guy image.Going into the late 2010s, a variety of Wojak variations emerged which saw the character drift away from his chan-culture origins. \"Wojak Comics\":Wojak Comics linked the character with other famous meme characters, often using his highly emotive face as a counterpoint to the stoicism of Yes Chad and others.By 2022, a wide variety of Wojak-based meme characters had emerged -- enough that Wojaks themselves could constitute a vocabulary to articulate highly sophisticated stories and arguments. For example, Redditor u/perpetualhillman posted a 7 × 7 political compass grid meme on September 5th, 2022, representing the types of people they had met during a trip to Ukraine as the Russian war against that country unfolded. Each personality in the meme is represented by a different Wojak or Wojak-adjacent character.[11]".

On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

The male equivalent is commonly referred to as a \"Husbando\"".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/waifu> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The term \"Waifu\" was first introduced to the English-speaking audiences through a scene from the popular high school anime series Azumanga Daioh, which aired in Japan from April to September 2002 and later released as a DVD set in the United States in September 2005. In the scene, the protagonist's perverted homeroom teacher Mr. Kimura drops a photograph of a mysterious woman on the classroom floor. When asked by his students about the person in the picture, Mr. Kimura simply replies: \"Mai Waifu.\"".

As \"mai waifu\" continued to appear on 4chan, a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) addressing the term was created as a supplement to the /a/ board.The first and only Urban Dictionary definition for \"Mai Waifu\" was created by user Surhta on April 2nd, 2007.However, the use of \"mai waifu\" is not restrictedly solely to anime or manga characters, as it has been seen with images of non-Japanese cartoon characters or even photographs of real life celebrities.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/goatse> <https://meme4.science/about> "Goatse (site domain: Goatse.cx) is a shock site featuring an image of a naked man stretching his anus with both of his hands. One of the most widespread shock media on the web, the site has been notoriously used for bait-and-switch pranks or website vandalisms to provoke reactions of disgust. Although the original domain was taken down in 2004,[1] the image continues to circulate online through mirrored sites.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/goatse> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The site was first launched in 1999 under the domain name Goatse.cx. According to the Wikipedia entry,[2] the earliest known instance of the shock image was uploaded circa 1997 as \"gap3.jpg\" in a set of 40 additional images compressed into a single zip file named \"Gap.zip.\" According to Gawker's investigative report published in April 2012,[5] the photo set initially spread across gay porn communities on Usenet and was later picked up by The Stiles Project.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/goatse> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Throughout the early 2000s, similar shock vandalisms and bait-and-switch pranks involving the image continued to flourish in chatrooms and message boards. On November 24th, 2000, the Goatse \"Giver\" and \"Receiver\" images were posted to the official Oprah Winfrey Message Boards in the Soul Stories board. Trystan T. Cotten and Kimberly Springer, the authors of Stories of Oprah: the Oprah-fication of American culture, later revealed that this \"seemingly considerable male intrusion drove many of the women elsewhere, and the board was retired shortly afterwards.\"On September 30th, 2002, the earliest known Urban Dictionary definition[3] for \"Goatse\" was submitted by user Bob Goatse, who described the term \"goatse\" as a colloquial verb when tricking someone into looking at the shock image:The tech news forum Slashdot was also forced to alter its thread display method after its users started a recreational game out of misleading clueless readers into visiting Goatse.cx.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/facepalm> <https://meme4.science/about> "Facepalm, also known as Facepalming, is a slang term that refers to the act of placing one's face in one's hand, a form of nonverbal-communication common among many cultures. The action conveys a message of dismay and is often a reaction toward someone's momentary lapse of logic, judgment or memory. This reaction may be directed toward another person or be self-deprecating. Online, people post various reaction images, GIFs and videos of people performing the motion as memes to express embarrassment towards someone else's actions.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/facepalm> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The facepalm, as an expression, existed long before the internet in both human and non-human societies. For example, an 1896 statue entitled \"Caïn\" by Henri Vidal, which resides in Tuileries Garden, Paris, France, was unveiled in 1896 (shown below, left).[1]One of the most famous and widely used variations of the facepalm comes from an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, which first aired on February 5th, 1990. The clip shows the character Captain Jean-Luc Picard (played by Patrick Stewart) reacting to a stressful situation by placing his hand on his face (shown below, right).The website Word Spy[2] cites a 2001 message board as the earliest usage of the expression. However, the actual post is no longer available.Therefore, the earliest available usage of the term online was posted on February 10th, 2004, by Urban Dictionary [3] user Moondog. They defined the action as, \"The act of dropping one's face / forehead into one's hand. Usually accompanied by a 'thunk' or a cr a cry of 'D'oh!' Usually written between asterisks in online conversation, to demonstrate an action.\" The post (shown below) received more than 2,500 upvotes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/facepalm> <https://meme4.science/spread> "The following year, on September 5th, 2005, the action was defined on the website Wiktionary[4] as \"To bring the palm(s) of one's hand(s) to one's face in mixed humor and disbelief (e.g.: when one is caught off-guard with a particularly bad pun).\"On May 1st, 2007, the website \"Facepalm.com\" was registered.[5]Two years later, on August 28th, 2009, Redditor [9] namsilat launched the /r/facepalm subreddit. The message board, as described by the moderators, is designed to share content that \"cause viewers to facepalm.\"In 2011, the Oxford English Dictionary[8] added the word and defined it as \"A gesture in which the palm of one's hand is brought to one's face as an expression of dismay, exasperation, embarrassment, etc.\"In 2016, the \"person facepalming\" or \"face palm emoji\" was accepted by Unicode [6] as an emoji (shown below).".

In February 2013, the song spawned a series of dance videos that begin with a masked individual dancing alone in a group before suddenly cutting to a wild dance party featuring the entire group. Despite what the name suggests,[1] the videos present a wide range of hip hop dances, including the Bernie, Twerking as well as improvisations.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harlem-shake> <https://meme4.science/origin> "\"Harlem Shake\" by Baauer[8], the stage name of American music producer Harry Rodrigues, was uploaded to YouTube on August 23rd, 2012 and released by Diplo's Mad Decent record label, under their sub label Jefferies initially as a free download, along with the B-side \"Yaow!\". The lyric \"do the Harlem Shake\" is a sample from the 2001 track \"Miller Time\" by Philadelphia party rap crew, Plastic Little. The lyric was taken from an incident in member Jayson Musson's life where he got into a fight and finished by getting up and doing the dance. Bauuer's song was met with positive reception from electronica & trap music blogs, as well as other artists including Diplo, Brodinski, and Flosstradamus. On January 30th, 2013, video blogger Filthy Frank uploaded an episode that opens with four people dressed in latex suits dancing to Baauer's \"Harlem Shake\" (shown below, right).".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepypasta> <https://meme4.science/about> "Creepypasta is a popular subgenre of copypasta which consists of short horror fictions and urban legends mainly distributed through word of mouth via online message boards or e-mail. In recent years, some authors have re-appropriated the genre into an effective pretext for bait-and-switch trolling.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "While folklores have been an essential part of cultural traditions for many centuries, the term \"urban legend\" began appearing in print publications as early as 1968 and became widespread through a series of books written by English professor Jan Harold Brunvand in the early 1980s. Since then, the word has become closely associated with short horror or mystery stories set in modern day. Starting in the 1990s, chain letter e-mails quickly emerged as the primary medium for sharing such stories on the Internet. [1]The Internet slang term \"creepypasta,\" which is derived from copypasta, did not enter the 4chan community's vernacular until mid-2007, with the earliest known archived thread[2] dating back to July 6th.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bye-felicia> <https://meme4.science/about> "\"Bye Felicia\" is a memorable quote from the 1995 comedy film Friday[19] which is often used online as a dismissive farewell.[18]".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bye-felicia> <https://meme4.science/origin> "On April 26th, 1995, the comedy film Friday was released, starring the characters Craig Jones (played by Ice Cube) and Smokey (played by Chris Tucker) as a pair of unemployed stoners who must find a way to pay a drug dealer $200 within 24 hours. In the film, a character named Felicia attempts to borrow a car and a marijuana cigarette from Smokey and Jones, causing Jones to say \"Bye Felicia.\" On March 11th, 2007, YouTuber HyFlyer988 uploaded a clip of the scene, gathering over 870,000 views and 290 comments in the first eight years.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bye-felicia> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On December 7th, 2008, Urban Dictionary[1] user pimpin'817 submitted an entry for \"bye felicia,\" describing the phrase as a way to bid farewell to someone who is deemed unimportant. On October 27th, 2011, YouTuber Mamclol uploaded a video titled \"Bye Felicia,\" featuring the clip from Friday with an accompanying hip hop track about the character.On January 14th, 2014, Redditor ArsenalZT asked why \"bye Felicia\" became popular in a post on the /r/OutOfTheLoop[2] subreddit. On August 4th, the phrase was discussed by guest Nicole Richie and host Ryan Seacrest during the radio talk show \"On Air with Ryan Seacrest\" (shown below).In April 2014, American makeup artist and model Jeffree Star posted dismissive tweets accompanied by the hashtag \"#byefelicia\" (shown below).[4][5] On June 18th, BuzzFeed[3] published a listicle titled \"22 Alternative Names to say 'Bye' to Instead of Felicia.\" According to the Twitter analytics site Topsy,[6] the hashtag #ByeFelicia was tweeted over 35,000 times during the month of August.In August 2015, online discussions about \"Bye Felicia\" saw another notable resurgence after its inclusion in a scene from Straight Outta Compton, an American biopic film about the 90s hip hop group N.W.A directed by F. Gary Gray, the same filmmaker behind the 1995 urban comedy movie and origin of the quote, Friday. In the film, a minor female character named \"Felicia\" makes an appearance at a raunchy post-performance party with the rappers at their hotel suite, which suddenly gets interrupted by two armed men knocking on the door and looking for their friend by the same name. After a brief moment of confrontation, members of the group find Felicia giving oral sex to Eazy-E, who eventually proceeds to push her out of the hotel room by the head. As the door slams behind, Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr.) drops the line \"Bye Felicia\" in a direct nod to the now-famous quote from Friday. While the film was generally met with critical acclaims upon its release, both the scene and the line were brought up by several film critics and hip hop bloggers for its abashedly misogynistic, slut-shaming undertone.Among the critics of the scene was New York Magazine writer Allison Davis, who reached out to the director for comments on the crude portrayal of black women in the film for her essay titled \"#ByeFelicia Gets an Uncomfortable New Origin Story.\"[8] In response, Gray defended the line by calling it \"one of the funniest moments in the movie\" and explained that it was completely made-up and improvised into the script by O’Shea Jackson Jr., the actor who portrays his real-life father and N.W.A member Ice Cube, on-the-spot during a late-night shoot. Upon being further pressed by Davis on whether he thought it was appropriate to include the pop-culture reference in such degrading context, Gray was quoted as saying:[9][10]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/about> "Copypasta is internet slang for any block of text that gets copied and pasted over and over again, typically disseminated by individuals through online discussion forums and social networking sites. The term is an English portmanteau of \"copy,\" \"paste\" and \"pasta.\" Although it shares some characteristics with spam in the sense they're both unsolicited (and often considered a nuisance), copypastas are mainly spread through human operators whereas the latter is automatically generated by electronic messaging systems.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "This simple concept of \"manually copying text from one place and pasting it elsewhere\" has been in practice since the innovation of basic text-editing commands (copy/cut/paste) in the early 1980s and subsequent rise of spamming in the early 1990s. In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of \"cut and paste\" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1]The origin of the term \"copypasta\" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, \"An amount of lengthy text that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to an irrelevant subject.\" The post received more than 170 upvotes in less than 15 years (shown below).".

More recently, the line \"F*ck Bitches, Get Money\" was also featured in Lil Wayne's 2005 track Money on My Mind. Since becoming popular on 4chan, Meme Generator and other lulz-friendly communities, the image macro has spawned an extensive pool of variations.".

The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".

As of April 26, 2011, the site has amassed over 19,968 pictures which translates into over 264 pages of images. According to the tags, the three most popular subjects for Rule 63 illustrations are Axis Power's Hetalia, Team Fortress 2, and Nintedo characters. The existence of Rule 63 could be attributed to similar themes explored by other rules like Rule 28 (\"Always question a person's gender, just in case it's really a man.\"), Rule 34 (\"There is porn of it; no exception.\") and Rule 35 (\"If no porn is found at the moment, it will be made.\").

While many of these threads went unarchived, search for Boxxy on Chanarchive[13] yields 1880 results as of April 2012.Following this video, twelve 4chan users met in an IRC channel, forming the Center for Boxxy Control and Restriction[11] (CBCR). The group broke in to Boxxy's YouTube account, making all of her videos private. They also uploaded a video explaining that she should never make another video and disclosing her personal information. After receiving negative backlash for these actions, the group made her videos public again and by January 19th, 2009, uploaded a second video apologizing for the hack.On January 19th, 2009, the Guardian[12] published an in-depth chronicle of 4chan's response to these videos, stating that Boxxy spam and flame wars had filled the image board to the point where 4chan users launched a denial of service (DDoS) attack on themselves on January 10th, 2009 out of protest. The same day, Boxxy's videos also appeared on Fimoculous[14], Buzzfeed[15] and Videogum.[16] That May, users organized a Twitter bomb[17] to get the hashtag #Boxxy trending on the site.Boxxy is also represented on other websites: A Boxxy Facebook fan page[18] has more than 25,600 likes, there are a handful of single topic blogs[21][22][23][24], and a Tumblr tag[25] associated with photos or videos of her.

The list serves as a summation of popular catchphrases and axioms commonly associated with 4chan. Since there are numerous drafts and editions in circulation, the rules fluctuate in number and the validity of each rule remains debatable. Despite this, several of the rules including Rule 34 and Rule 63 are agreed upon across internet communities.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rules-of-the-internet> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The idea of making a set of rules, similar to Netiquette[5] for 4chan users, was initially talked about on Anonymous-related IRC channels before an entry was submitted to Encyclopedia Dramatica sometime in late 2006 and archived[6] on January 10th, 2007. The entry was highly debated on its discussion page[7] as well as the site’s forums. At the time of the archival, there were 18 rules in the entry, despite it mentioning that 48 existed.".

The earliest Yahoo! Answers[11] question seeking the original Rules was posted on June 13th, 2007, with the top answer linking to the Encyclopedia Dramatica page. A wiki-style site for the Rules of the Internet[8] was established in December 2007 to document every rule that circulated the web. When the site was first archived[9] in October 2008, 180 rules existed. As of June 2012, the site lists rules numbering in the 900s. In January 2008, a set of 100 rules was added to Urban Dictionary [3]A set of 47 rules exists on an Encyclopedia Dramatica[1] entry as of June 2012. This set also has been documented on the Internet Archive[10] as a community text.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ayy-lmao> <https://meme4.science/about> "\"Ayy LMAO\" is an expression and Tumblr hashtag which is almost always associated with pictures of aliens.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ayy-lmao> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The image of the alien has circulated the web since as early as November 2012, appearing on a number of Portuguese and Spanish-language paranormal sites including Tempo Espaço[1], El Gurú[2] and El Rincon Paranormal.[3] Though it is unclear where the photo was first posted, it was referenced on Twitter on March 31st, 2013 in a conversation between two users.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ayy-lmao> <https://meme4.science/spread> "By May 23rd, 2013, the image appeared as a reaction comment on the celebrity gossip blog Oh No They Didn't.[4] On June 8th, a Facebook fan page[5] titled \"AYY LMAO\" launched, posting a handful of image macros with the phrase but not the alien photo. That August, YouTuber jorin pop created a seven second video (shown below) pairing the image with the phrase \"ayy lmao\" in a hot pink font scrolling across the screen.On September 22nd, Tumblr user haunted-sugoi[6] posted the image with the caption \"this is all that matters.\" Three days later, the single topic blog Ayy Lmao Alien[7] was created and began reblogging other photos of aliens with the caption from across Tumblr. On October 15th, a second Facebook fan page titled Ayy Lmao[9] was created, this time, using the familiar alien image as its cover photo. Around the same time, a Yahoo! Answers[10] question was asked about the meaning of the phrase. Later that month, a /r/AyyLmao[11] subreddit was also created. As of October 28th, there are 21 Tumblr URLs, both parked and active, that use a variation of Ayy Lmao.[8]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/true-story> <https://meme4.science/about> "True Story is a rage comic character based on a black and white contour drawing of How I Met Your Mother character Barney Stinson (played by actor Neil Patrick Harris) smiling smugly while holding a wine glass. Often accompanied by the text “true story,” the character can mostly be found in the final panel of a rage comic to either indicate or falsely claim that it is based on a true story.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/true-story> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The colloquial expression \"true story\" has been used as an affirmative statement to corroborate one's claim or allegation. Online, one of the earliest archived instances of this was posted on three separate Usenet newsgroups on November 2nd, 1995.[9] The post contained a diatribe criticizing the logic of seasoned posters who were complaining about an influx of newbies to Usenet. As an aside, author David Sewell used an example from his real life with a \"true story\" disclaimer, comparing the actions of a professor complaining about a student playing loud music to the way the older Usenet users were acting towards newcomers.An Urban Dictionary[3] definition for the phrase used in this manner was submitted nearly ten years later on June 20th, 2004. “True Story” gained much of its catchphrase status through the character Barney Stinson from the TV sitcom series How I Met Your Mother[1], which began airing in 2005. Throughout the show, Stinson frequently uses the expression “True Story” as an ending to theories or stories that are for the most part probably false or nonsense.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/true-story> <https://meme4.science/spread> "The character was added to All The Rage Faces[15] on September 11th, 2011. The “True Story” character quickly took off on the f7u12 subreddit, which has more than 12,000 results[14] for the phrase as of September 2012, and numerous rage comics based on the character have been featured across other internet humor blogs, including Memebase[5], FunnyJunk[7] and 9gag.[8] The popularity of the phrase also led to an image macro generator page on DIYLOL.[4] Related merchandises featuring the “True Story” character can be also found on Zazzle[6] and Etsy.[16]Additional rage comics using the character continue to be shared on Memebase[10], Rage Comic Archive[13] and Tumblr[11], where users will also simply use the image as a reaction face in a text post. A Facebook fan page[12] for the character has more than 157,000 likes as of September 2012.".

During the interview, she stated that she had woken up to get a “cold pop” when she thought someone was grilling before she realized there was a fire.

Others have included Hey You, Pikachu!, a game where players could interact with Pikachu with a microphone, Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu!, and Poképark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure.

In recent years, some authors have re-appropriated the genre into an effective pretext for bait-and-switch trolling.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "While folklores have been an essential part of cultural traditions for many centuries, the term \"urban legend\" began appearing in print publications as early as 1968 and became widespread through a series of books written by English professor Jan Harold Brunvand in the early 1980s. Since then, the word has become closely associated with short horror or mystery stories set in modern day. Starting in the 1990s, chain letter e-mails quickly emerged as the primary medium for sharing such stories on the Internet. [1]The Internet slang term \"creepypasta,\" which is derived from copypasta, did not enter the 4chan community's vernacular until mid-2007, with the earliest known archived thread[2] dating back to July 6th.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cool-story-bro> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The phrase \"cool story\"[2] used as a sarcastic response to a narrative was first seen in the 2001 film Zoolander[5], where actor Owen Wilson's character Hansel tells a long winded story about a drug-induced hallucination. In response, a background character named Olaf yells out from across the room, \"Cool story, Hansel\" while laughing.\"Cool Story, Bro\" began on 4chan's /v/ (video games) board[8], used as a response to posts containing personal or lengthy stories as early as July 18th, 2008[9] in a thread for sad moments in a person's gaming life. Image macros followed, initially paired with a panel from Marvel Comics' The Incredible Hercules #122.[6] The issue was inked by Clayton Henry and Salvador Espin and published on October 29th, 2008, showing Hercules during a flashback right before he finds out his friend Queen Hippolyta had been killed.[7]".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cool-story-bro> <https://meme4.science/spread> "\"Cool story, bro\" was first defined on Urban Dictionary[4] on January 5th, 2009. In July of that year, the first Yahoo! Answers[13] inquiry about the phrase was asked. The phrase was discussed on Slate[12] in May 2011 as useful tool in commenting on wordy posts. A Twitter account, @CoolStoryBro[16], was created on October 17th, 2011 which reposts tweets that are deemed deserving of the sarcastic response.\"Cool Story Bro\" spread to real life as an expression of one's complete indifference towards someone else's remark through the MTV reality show Jersey Shore. Sometimes paired with the phrase “Tell it Again,” the phrase has been made into t-shirts[14] at the store where the cast members are employed. There are two Facebook fan pages[11][15] for the phrase, with over 133,000 likes between them as of March 2012.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/about> "Copypasta is internet slang for any block of text that gets copied and pasted over and over again, typically disseminated by individuals through online discussion forums and social networking sites. The term is an English portmanteau of \"copy,\" \"paste\" and \"pasta.\" Although it shares some characteristics with spam in the sense they're both unsolicited (and often considered a nuisance), copypastas are mainly spread through human operators whereas the latter is automatically generated by electronic messaging systems.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "This simple concept of \"manually copying text from one place and pasting it elsewhere\" has been in practice since the innovation of basic text-editing commands (copy/cut/paste) in the early 1980s and subsequent rise of spamming in the early 1990s. In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of \"cut and paste\" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1]The origin of the term \"copypasta\" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, \"An amount of lengthy text that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to an irrelevant subject.\" The post received more than 170 upvotes in less than 15 years (shown below).".

Attracting more than 78,000 users in less than 12 years, the subreddit allows users to share text to various copypasta templates.Nearly a decade later, on September 14th, 2018, Merriam Webster's Dictionary[4] considered \"copypasta\" in their \"Words We're Watching\" series.

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

Since its release in mid-July 2012, the highly entertaining music video has spawned hundreds of parodies and copycat dance videos on YouTube and surpassed Justin Bieber's single \"Baby\" as the most watched video on YouTube with over one billion views as of December 21st, 2012.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gangnam-style> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The song \"Gangnam Style\" was written, produced, and recorded as the lead single of PSY 6 (Six Rules), Part 1 the sixth studio album of South Korean singer and rapper PSY, who is best known for his quick-witted sense of humor and comical dance moves. The song was released on July 15th, 2012 along with the music video via PSY's official YouTube channel.Upon its release, the song took off on virtually all Korean billboard charts, portal search sites and online music stores, but it began garnering international attention after the music video went viral on YouTube during the third week of July 2012. The video continued gaining viral momentum at an average rate of more than nine million views per day in the span of two months, surpassing Carly Rae Jepsen's \"Call Me Maybe\" to reach the number one position on the YouTube Top 100 Music Videos chart during the last week of August. By mid-September, PSY's \"Gangnam Style\" overtook LMFAO's \"Party Rock Anthem\" as the most liked video on the site with more than 1.6 million likes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gangnam-style> <https://meme4.science/spread> "The video earned the title of ''viral video'' within days after its release and received intensive coverage from various English-language music blogs and K-POP news sites like AllKPop[8], KPopStars[3] and KoreaBoo[16], as well as other regional Asian news sites including Yahoo! Philippines News[17] and New Zealand music sites Mai FM[9] and George FM.[10] In the following weeks, the music video picked up notable mentions from internet humor and pop music sites, from Gawker[18], BuzzFeed[11] and FunnyJunk[12] to Metafilter[13] and PopDust[14] among others.By the first week of August, PSY's Gangnam Style had been praised as a viral YouTube sensation by major U.S. news outlets like CNN[19], ABC News[20] and The Wall Street Journal[21], further boosting the popularity of his music video. In addition, the song's chorus hook \"Oppan Gangnam Style\" quickly became an in-joke among the English-speaking audiences for its misheard lyrics erroneously referred to as \"Open Condom Style\" or \"Open Gundam Style,\" which also went onto inspire several image macros and top-voted comments on the YouTube video page.Between late July and early August, the song picked up numerous endorsements from high-profile celebrities and musicians on Twitter, including British pop singer Robbie Williams[15], American rapper T-Pain and American singer Josh Groban. Weeks later in mid-August, Korean and U.S. news outlets reported on a rumor that Justin Bieber has also shown interest in PSY's work and a potential collaboration between the two singers was in progress. On September 20th, 2012, \"Gangnam Style\" was officially recognized by the Guinness World Records as the most liked video in YouTube history with 2,141,758 likes at the time of announcement.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cursed-images--2> <https://meme4.science/about> "Cursed Images are a type of picture and photograph on the internet that are generally seen as disturbing to the viewer, typically due to the poor photo quality or content within the image that is abnormal or illogical. Images of this or similar nature are sometimes seen as the visual equivalent to creepypastas and occasionally are captioned with the specific phrase \"Cursed Image.\" Since the term appeared online in 2015, such pictures have inspired several social media accounts devoted to posting various cursed images, subreddits and other communities. The opposite of cursed images are referred to as \"blessed,\" while images that are both cursed and blessed are referred to as \"blursed.\"".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cursed-images--2> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The term and overall idea of cursed images initially started on Tumblr, and the first account to publish exclusively cursed images was CursedImages.[3] On October 28th, 2015, they published their first post. The image, shown below, gained over 1,200 notes in two years.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cursed-images--2> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Following the original Tumblr account dedicated to posting such imagery in late 2015, there have been several more Tumblr blogs oriented around sharing cursed images.[2] In the following years, the idea of cursed images spread outside of Tumblr when the Twitter account @cursedimages[1] devoted to posting these pictures launched in July 2016. This account uploaded its first post on July 29th, 2016, and gained over 100,000 followers in four months before going dormant. The success of the Twitter account notably drew media attention from New York Magazine,[4] The New Yorker,[5] Gizmodo[6] and more who covered the trend that year.On September 8th, 2016, cursed images then spread to Reddit with the creation of the /r/cursedimages[8] subreddit, which accumulated over 1.5 million members in roughly six years. On October 31st, 2019, Redditor MinimumSpecGamer posted the top-voted image as of January 2023 to the subreddit, notably part of the Like This Image to Die Instantly meme, garnering over 77,300 upvotes in three years (seen below).Throughout the late 2010s and early 2020s, the concept of cursed images also spread beyond just pictures with the introduction of terms such as cursed memes, cursed emojis, cursed videos, cursed compilations and cursed comments, among many others, that similarly evoked a disturbing, creepy or abnormal element to them.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepypasta> <https://meme4.science/about> "Creepypasta is a popular subgenre of copypasta which consists of short horror fictions and urban legends mainly distributed through word of mouth via online message boards or e-mail. In recent years, some authors have re-appropriated the genre into an effective pretext for bait-and-switch trolling.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "While folklores have been an essential part of cultural traditions for many centuries, the term \"urban legend\" began appearing in print publications as early as 1968 and became widespread through a series of books written by English professor Jan Harold Brunvand in the early 1980s. Since then, the word has become closely associated with short horror or mystery stories set in modern day. Starting in the 1990s, chain letter e-mails quickly emerged as the primary medium for sharing such stories on the Internet. [1]The Internet slang term \"creepypasta,\" which is derived from copypasta, did not enter the 4chan community's vernacular until mid-2007, with the earliest known archived thread[2] dating back to July 6th.".

Once the dragon has been killed, the player absorbs its soul and discovers he is a rare chosen hero known as a \"Dragon-Born\" who is blessed with the ability to perform various powerful shouts. \"Fus\" is the first shout the player learns of the 24 that can be discovered in the game. It fires a shock-wave of force energy that stuns and pushes enemies. After visiting the Gray Beards at High Hrothgar, the player learns the more powerful shout \"Fus Ro Dah\" that can be translated as \"force balance push.\"An Urban Dictionary[8] definition was created on August 23rd, 2011.

The term is an English portmanteau of \"copy,\" \"paste\" and \"pasta.\" Although it shares some characteristics with spam in the sense they're both unsolicited (and often considered a nuisance), copypastas are mainly spread through human operators whereas the latter is automatically generated by electronic messaging systems.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "This simple concept of \"manually copying text from one place and pasting it elsewhere\" has been in practice since the innovation of basic text-editing commands (copy/cut/paste) in the early 1980s and subsequent rise of spamming in the early 1990s. In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of \"cut and paste\" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1]The origin of the term \"copypasta\" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, \"An amount of lengthy text that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to an irrelevant subject.\" The post received more than 170 upvotes in less than 15 years (shown below).".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".

Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".

According to VH1's PopUp Video, record executives who heard his recordings didn't believe it was his voice either at first[3].In February 2008, during the Anonymous' Project Chanology protests against the Church of Scientology, \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" was played from boomboxes, performed, and shouted. The UK daily The Guardian[4] called it “a live rick-rolling of the Church of Scientology\" (shown below, left). On April 1st, 2008, every featured video on YouTube's front page redirected to the Rickroll music video [5] (shown below, right).In April 2008, the New York Mets baseball team's site posted an online poll[6] to select the song for the 8th inning sing-along. On April 4th, 2008, FARK users bombarded the poll with upvotes for \"Never Gonna Give You Up.\" On April 7th, the Mets announced that the song had won with over five million votes. Rather than using the song for the 8th inning, it was apparently used during the home opener, much to the displeasure of Mets fans (shown below, left).In November 2008, the Rickroll meme came to a full circle when Rick Astley himself appeared on a float during the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade[7], lip synching to his classic hit from 24 years ago (shown below, right).Rick Astley was nominated for the Best Act Ever award for the MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2008, when the voting forum was flooded by fans of the Rickrolling phenomenon[8]. Astley has voiced his approval of the off-beat joke, stating \"MTV was thoroughly Rickrolled\" (shown below, left).On January 13, 2009, United States Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi published a video in honor of the launch of the HouseHub YouTube channel featuring the Rick Astley music video at the end (shown below, right).In April 2009, co-writer of \"Never Gonna Give You Up,\" Pete Waterman, denounced Google and YouTube at a press conference that announced the launch of a website campaigning for a fairer deal for songwriters whose work is featured on YouTube. He was quoted saying, \"Panorama did a documentary on the exploitation of foreign workers in Dubai. I feel like one of those workers, because I earned less for a year's work off Google or YouTube than they did off the Bahrain government.\"[10]In February 2010, a bipartisan group of Oregon Representatives planned to pull off the \"Rickroll\" during House sessions. Each of the participants was given a portion of the lyrics of \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" to subtly plug into their statements during legislative discussion. This scheme was finally revealed on April 1st, 2011, when Representative Jefferson Smith and his co-conspirators edited and uploaded a video of various representatives making their statements, put in proper lyrical order of the song (shown below).Just as the world was fully grasping Wikileaks for the first time, amid dense publications of top secret cables, the arrest of Julian Assange in the UK, and Operation Payback which included serious attacks on Visa, MasterCard, Amazon and Paypal, one purported Wikileak document titled \"England: Reliability and Longevity of UK-US Relationship Confirmed\" was probably more read than any other:Originally posted on the eve of December 9th, 2010, readers who clicked through the hidden link were led to a document[9] that includes the lyrics to the Rick Astley's song:On July 27th, 2011, Twitter user @wiggsd tweeted \"This WH correspondence briefing isn't nearly as entertaining as yesterday's.\" The official White House Twitter account, @whitehouse, replied to the tweet with a link to the Rick Astley video on YouTube.On May 23rd, 2012, the original \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" YouTube video was taken down for 24-hrs following a copyright complaint[11].On June 3rd, 2013, Will Smidlein managed to upload the full Rick Astley music video to Vine the same day Vine introduced the new app for Android. Smidlein took to Twitter to announce his accomplishment and later regret[12]. (shown below)On July 17th, 2014, YouTube blocked the original video uploaded by YouTube user cotter548 in several countries including the United States[13].In August 2015, Rock band, The Foo Fighters, rolled past Westboro Baptist protesters in the bed of a truck blasting Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" in Kansas City, Missouri starting a dance party[14] (shown below).In September 2015, Apple Rick Rolled customers accessing the Apple Watch Support Page[15]. The “Add a friend” tutorial section featured an image of the watches contact list with the initials spelling out, \"NE VE RG ON NA GI VE YU UP\" (shown below).On November 18, 2015, hacker group, Anonymous, announced on Twitter that they would be \"spamming verified ISIS hashtags with rickrolls\" [16]. On November 24th, the group announced on Twitter that their \"first yet simple hashtag to #RickrollDaesh is #SupportISIS.\"In April 2016, pro-EU campaigner, Mario Van Poppel, claimed the Vote Leave domain name before Vote Leave Campaigners. He redirected users from the site to a YouTube video of \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" [17].On July 18th, 2016, Melania Trump made a speech at the National Republican Convention in which she said that her husband Donald Trump \"will never, ever, give up. And, most importantly, he will never, ever, let you down\" [18]. Twitter users took notice and commented over whether it was intentional or not [19].On October 7th, 2016, Astley participated in an \"ask me anything\" (AMA) thread on the /r/Music[20] subreddit, which gathered more than 63,900 points (90% upvoted) and 6,900 comments prior to being archived.On August 20th, 2017, The Foo Fighters rickrolled their audience in Tokyo when they brought special guest, Rick Astley on stage to sing \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" (shown below, left).On April 9th, 2018, The creators of the television show Westworld posted a video entitled Westworld Season 2 -- A Primer promising spoilers but all viewers got was a video of cast members singing \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" (shown below, right).In February of 2020, YouTuber Revideo posted a \"4K\" edit of the original video using video manipulating software (shown below). This perturbed Twitter users when it was reposted there two weeks later, causing \"Rick Astley\" to trend on the site.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/high-expectations-asian-father> <https://meme4.science/about> "High Expectations Asian Father is an advice animal image macro series based on stereotypes and cliches about first-generation Asian parents pushing their children to excel in academic fields in an overbearing manner.[21] TCentered around a photograph of a middle-aged Asian man with glasses and grey hair, the captioned image series also went on to inspire a female counterpart advice animal known as Tiger Mom in January 2011.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bait-and-switch-media> <https://meme4.science/about> "Bait-and-switch Media refers to various trolling pictures and videos that trick a user into viewing unexpected content, usually through fake linking, misleading thumbnails or titles and other duping techniques. While the Rickroll is one of the oldest and most well-known examples, others can include more nefarious switches with links to sites that cause computer viruses, shock sites or other NSFW media, so long as the intention is to trick an unsuspecting user into viewing something unintended.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bait-and-switch-media> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The name and original concept for bait-and-switch media online stem from the term \"bait-and-switch,\" which originated as a form of fraud in retail sales and commercial culture. The oldest text mentioning the use of this technique comes from Zhang Yingyu's The Book of Swindles, released in 1617, a Chinese book of stories about fraud.[1]One of the earliest and most well-known examples of this technique being used online comes from the viral video \"Ghost Car\" that was released in 2005. In this commercial, viewers are shown a serene landscape with a car driving through rolling green hills when suddenly a monster appears and screams to shock viewers. The video was uploaded on July 30th, 2005, by YouTuber[2] mrsmithereen and has since been viewed over 37.5 million times in roughly 15 and a half years (seen below).Easily the most infamous bait-and-switch video, Rickrolling originated shortly after in 2006 and quickly became the most popularized method of duping people with the technique. YouTuber[3] Erik Helwig, better known as Hot Dad, claimed to have prank called a Michigan radio station after a sports game and played \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" over the phone on August 31st, 2006. The story was explained in a YouTube video titled \"I Did the First Rickroll (w/ Proof)\" uploaded on August 7th, 2015 (shown below).".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/exploitables> <https://meme4.science/about> "Exploitables are a meme template in which a single image is manipulated through various means to achieve the intended, humorous effect. This can involve replacing words in the original image, adding words to the original image, or manipulating positions of objects in the image to change the original's meaning. Exploitables often grow popular due to the fact they don't require extensive photo-editing knowledge to create and can be modified by basic programs such as MS Paint or Photoshop. Multiple types of exploitable meme templates arose throughout the late 2000s and 2010s, and many of the most recognizable memes are exploitables, such as Loss, Distracted Boyfriend and Galaxy Brain.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/exploitables> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Exploitables began becoming a regular part of internet memes in 2006. That year saw the rise of one of the first popular exploitable templates, Bitches Don't Know. The meme originated when MySpace user Rich Owens wore a shirt saying \"Bitches Don't Know Bout My Dick\" (shown below, left) The photo was edited by multiple users to make the shirt read something else (examples shown below, center, right). This was one of the first \"single-pane\" exploitable templates (an exploitable based off one image) to grow into a popular meme.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/exploitables> <https://meme4.science/spread> "On April 13th, 2009, Urban Dictionary [1] user patsybunbury posted a definition for \"exploitable\" that reads, \"Adjective used to describe an image, often a movie or cartoon still, which can be easily captioned, edited or labelled in a variety of ways for the purposes of humour\" (shown below).Throughout meme history, there have been multiple popular genres of exploitable memes.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another.[2] A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes.

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ptsd-clarinet-boy> <https://meme4.science/about> "PTSD Clarinet Boy is an advice animal image macro series based on a double exposure portrait of a redheaded boy dressed in a school band uniform holding a clarinet. A full-body image of the uniformed boy gazing out is superimposed on to the back of his head. The captions typically emulate the first-person accounts of a war veteran suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, interpreting the dual images of the boy as him mulling over the past. The captions have since evolved to become similar to those found in the Karate Kyle and Vengeance Dad series, often relating to being deemed a loser in high school.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ptsd-clarinet-boy> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The original image was posted in the single topic blog Awkward Family Photos[1] on July 17th, 2009. Titled \"A Beautiful Mind,\" the caption asked readers to think about what was going on in the young boy's head. By December 2009, the image was picked up by the image macro creating site Meme Generator, where it initially was called \"Veteran PTSD Clarinet Boy,\" adopting the voice of Vietnam war veterans remembering the past. However, it is unclear what the first instance of this was.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ptsd-clarinet-boy> <https://meme4.science/spread> "One of the earliest mentions of the series outside of Meme Generator was posted to the Pro Touring automobile enthusiast forums[10] on December 31st, 2009 in a thread comparing Firebirds and Camaros. On January 8th, 2010, a thread dedicated to the series was posted on the Ultimate Guitar forums.[11] By the end of January, the name of the series had been shortened to PTSD Clarinet Boy and was posted to Tumblr[12] for the first time. One of the earliest archived 4chan threads using the series was posted to /a/ (Anime and Manga) on February 7th, 2010.On February 12th, a thread about PTSD Clarinet Boy was started on the Bodybuilding.com forums[14], generating 12 pages of responses. Four days later, a Facebook fan page[15] for the series was created, gaining just under 1,500 likes as of July 2013. That April, a collection of PTSD Clarinet Boy images were combined in a FunnyJunk[5] post that has since been viewed nearly 25,000 times. The series saw a renewed interest in February 2011 with a compilation posted on Buzzfeed.[16] The next month, a single topic Tumblr titled PTSD Clarinet Kid[17] was created, but was abandoned after 48 posts.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-hope-senpai-will-notice-me> <https://meme4.science/origin> "Senpai[1], sometimes spelled \"sempai\", is a Japanese honorific term used when speaking to someone of an elevated social status in schools, dojos or sports clubs.

On August 12th, an ask blog from the point of view of Senpai[6] was created. Over the next three days, blogs titled \"I Am Senpai And I Just\"[7], \"Your Senpai Noticed You And\"[8] and \"Senpai Noticed You Then\"[9] were created with the intention of utilizing Tumblr's notification feature to make joke sentences when liking and reblogging posts found on the senpai tag.In September 2012, the Facebook fan page \"I hope Senpai will notice me\"[12] was created, gaining more than 200 fans as of September 2013. The phrase has continued to be popular on Tumblr, where the tags \"I hope senpai notices me\"[14] and the positive \"senpai noticed me\"[15] are all active. It can also be found mentioned on deviantART[13], where there are more than 1,100 search results for \"senpai notice me.\"In January of 2014, PewDiePie created a compilation video of all the times he said \"Senpai will notice me\" in his vlogs; subsequently, interest in the phrase spiked.".

Normally they are used when one is referring to one's interlocutor, as using on oneself is often seen as arrogant. Dropping the honorific implies a high degree of intimacy and this action is often reserved for close friends, one's spouse, or social inferiors (for example, a teacher addressing his students). The honorifics fall into three different categories depending on the type of speech the speaker is using (shown below).".

These usages predate their online usage.Japanese honorifics are in wide conversational use on anime fan-boards and forums, and their use has spread to other subjects where users might have an overlapping interest in anime, including the user forums of 4chan.org and the chat boxes of Twitch.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

One of the earliest Tumblrs to organize live streams of the original show was Wallopin Websnappers[4], launched by a user named Hobbo who started the blog in November 2010[6] as a place to organize livestream viewings and collect the 700 screencaps he had collected from the show.Tumblr blogs exclusively dedicated to collecting captioned instances of 60s Spider-Man did not appear until February 1st, 2011, with the creation of You're a horrible man, Spiderman Brown.[3] More single-topic Tumblrs were started later that year[1][2], in addition to an active Tumblr tag.[12]Between April and July of 2011, compilations of captioned Spider-Man images were also shared on Reddit[11], FunnyJunk[12], Uproxx[13], humor blog Pleated Jeans[14], #1 Meme[15], and geek culture blog The Uniblog.[16] Several generators[17] exist on MemeGenerator with different still images from the series.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/about> "Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another.[2] A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures.[1] He postulated that perhaps not only biological information undergoes natural selection and that anything that is capable of replicating itself would also be susceptible to selection pressures, like ideas and beliefs. The word \"meme\" was used to label this type of self-replicating cultural information, and it was derived from the Greek word mimema, which translates to \"something imitated\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes> <https://meme4.science/spread> "With the commercialization of the internet in 1995,[6] modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[5]".
